Conducted every Friday after school hours, teams are made up of students from different class level to compete with one another, at the same time, promoting fair play and teamwork and to cultivate positive attitudes and self-expression.

For the very first time, the school has invited girls to showcase their talent in futsal as well and this has promoted positive self-esteem and mindset that allows the athlete to continually grow and improve.
