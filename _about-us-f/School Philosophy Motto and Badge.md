**School Philosophy**


The school aims to provide each student with a balanced education, developing him to his fullest potential because we believe that each student is capable of learning and excelling, given the right motivation and support.  
  

**School Goal**


To foster national pride and loyalty based on the acceptance and respect for a multicultural, multi-religious and multilingual society. In fulfilling the above, it is implicit that pupils be aware at all times of the need to work as a team, conscious of the fact that there is no alternative to hard work to ensure progress for self and nation.
