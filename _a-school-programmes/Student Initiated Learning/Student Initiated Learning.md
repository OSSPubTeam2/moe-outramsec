**Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) Pilot for Secondary Three Normal Academic/ Express Students** 

The Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) programme is part of the Ministry of Education’s blueprint for students to grow to be independent learners who learn for life. At Outram Secondary School, we have designed a unique experience for Outramians that seeks to develop their intrinsic motivation and nurture self-directed learning, where they can explore their interests and passions, and learn within and beyond the curriculum.
