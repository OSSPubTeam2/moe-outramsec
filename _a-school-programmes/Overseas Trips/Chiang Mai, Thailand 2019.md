Sawatdee! As part of the 5-day Cultural Immersion Programme, a group of 18 Secondary 3 students and 3 teachers made their way to Chiang Mai, Thailand on 29 October 2019. The programme sought to provide the Secondary 3 students with an opportunity for to learn and interact with youths from a different cultural background. 

In Chiang Mai, the students visited City Moat as part of the cultural orientation tour. To foster an understanding and appreciation for Thai culture and the arts, they went to Borsang Village for an umbrella painting session. In addition, the students participated in a cultural exchange with the Thai students of Chomthong Secondary School. 

The highlight of the trip was an immersive experience at the Elephant Conservation Centre as well as the Doi Inthanon National Park, where the students found themselves shivering in the chilly weather. The trip came to an end as they made their way back home to Singapore with precious insights and treasured memories from their time in Chiang Mai.
