**Overseas-Experiential Learning Programme 2018 – Seoul, Korea**

_Annyeong Haseyo!_ On 9 November, a team of 22 beaming secondary three students, and 3 teachers descended upon Seoul, Korea for a 5-day Overseas Experiential Learning Programme (OELP).  The programme seeks to promote cultural awareness and meaningful interactions with Korean Counterparts, develop an understanding and appreciation in our students about South Korea and its culture and to visit business entities in Korea to gain wider perspectives on business operations.

In Seoul, students visited the well-known Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), an outstanding film studio that produces HD digital TV dramas to visit the sets and to learn about drama production. The team visited famous shopping districts and retailers to experience Seoul’s robust retail economy. The highlight of the trip was an exclusive face-to-face interview with a successful Singaporean entrepreneur in Seoul’s food and beverage business, Mr Jonathan Quek! Not only did his share his hard fought journey on breaking into the F&B scene in Seoul, but also genuine and noteworthy advice with our students.

Our students also visited two schools; Mullae Middle School and Jamsil Middle School and revelled in a fresh cultural exchange with Korean students. Other cultural delights came in the form of DIY fried chicken-making and a visit to the Korean Folk Museum and Gyungbok Palace. The 5-day experiential programme came to a close all too soon on 13 November as students brought home precious insights into the thriving South Korean commercial scene and its globally popular cultural offerings.
