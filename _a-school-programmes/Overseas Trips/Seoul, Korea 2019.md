On 2nd&nbsp;November, a group of 23 eager Secondary Three students and 3 teachers travelled to the beautiful city of Seoul, South Korea for a 5-day Overseas Experiential Learning Programme (OELP). The purpose of the trip was for students to gain a better understanding of South Korean culture and traditions as well as to gain insight into its business operations.&nbsp;

In Seoul, the students visited Incheon Free Economic Zone (FIEZ), a self-contained living and business district featuring air and sea transportation, a logistics complex, an international business center and financial services. Subsequent visits to Samsung Innovation Museum, Gwancheon National Museum and Korea Broadcasting System (KBS) also taught the students about the spirit of innovation that drove the rapid progress of Korea in the areas of technology and entertainment.&nbsp;

One of the highlights of the trip was the opportunity to visit the Merlion Cafe, a food and beverage business started by Mr Ken Ng. Through an interview over kaya toast and Singaporean drinks, the students were given an insight into the challenges and opportunities he faced as an entrepreneur in a foreign country. In addition, the students had guided tours around Kookmin and Shinhan University, where they learnt about the various strategies adopted by the Universities to prepare future-ready students equipped with the necessary skills for the 21st&nbsp;Century.&nbsp;

Last but not least, the Nanta show deserves the spotlight for its hilarious non-verbal performance which left both the teachers and students in fits of laughter. The 5-day experiential programme eventually came to an end as students brought home memorable lessons about the thriving South Korean commercial scene and its globally popular culture.&nbsp;
