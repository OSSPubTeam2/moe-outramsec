The MTL department CL Unit organized the annual Outram Superstar Singing Competition on 21 May 2015. In conjunction with SG50 celebration, we set “Xin Yao” as the theme for this year’s competition.  

“Xin Yao” is a genre of songs that is unique to Singapore, where the songs are composed and sung by young Singaporeans and are usually about life in this small island country. Our students have to choose from these “Xin Yao” songs to compete in the competition. This gave greater meaning to our singing competition this year as we create greater awareness and appreciation of local music culture.

The Mother Tongue Language Department Chinese Language Unit participated in the PAssion Fiesta @ Heartlands (Yuhua) on 7 & 8 March 2015 oragnised by People’s Assocaition. This activity involved our students who learnt Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) under the Enhanced Mother Tongue Language Curriculum.

We were invited to set up a booth at Yuhua. As the TCM ambassadors, our students shared health tips with the public and conducted games during the event. At the same time, they also gained greater knowledge through their interaction with the other TCM counterparts who were there to conduct health talks for the residents.

It was a meaningful and enriching learning experience for the students.
