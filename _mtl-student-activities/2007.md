#### **Cultural Immersion Tour - From Xi’An to Singapore 2007**

On 6th July to 10th July 2007, 46 students and teachers, including their Principal and Vice-Principal, from Xi’An 38 High School came to Singapore for a 5-day cultural immersion tour. They went sightseeing on 7th and 8th of July, and visited places of interest like the Singapore Science Centre, Mount Faber, Setonsa, Zoological Gardens, Kampong Glam, Little India, Singapore River and the Merlion Park. On the last day, they also went to the Duty Free Shop to do some final shopping.

Among them, 20 students were attached to our school to attend 2 days of programmes and lessons. They first toured our school, had a better view on the school environment before they met their buddies to join them in class. In the afternoon, rock climbing activity and a basketball friendly match were arranged for them. On their 2nd day in school, they had the opportunity to bake cookies and complete an Indian rangoli. They also visited the Malay and Tamil Cultural rooms to learn more about their culture.

At the end of the tour, Xi’An students had a better understanding of the Singapore culture and the school learning environment. Our students also played as good hosts to their buddies from Xi’An. It was indeed an enriching and enjoyable trip for all. A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed with the Xi’An 38 High School. We look forward to meeting them again in the near future.

#### **Indian Cultural Carnival at NIE 2007**

A group of us, 13 sec two and three TL students, from our school participated in the Indian Cultural Carnival organized by NIE on 24th March 2007. We set up booth on Indian Traditional Games. The objective of the carnival was to give hands- on experience to primary school pupils who visited the booth. About 300 primary pupils visited our booth. We engaged them by demonstrating the various Indian Traditional games. These games really fascinated them as we could see from the enthusiasm they displayed. We also prepared quiz sheets for these students. The questions were based on the games information charts we prepared.

Our booth was the most visited booth and we thoroughly enjoyed imparting information to the young children. It was a meaningful experience that we look forward to having again.
