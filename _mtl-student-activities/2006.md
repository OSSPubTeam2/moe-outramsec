#### **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2006.**

On the 27 th February 2006 , Friday, after weeks of rehearsal sessions, the Spring Festival concert organized by the Mother Tongue Department commenced with two pieces by our school’s Chinese Orchestra. Like the previous years, we had the honour of celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year with 25 senior citizens from Chin Swee Road .

This year, the Mother Tongue Department attempted something new. Instead of presenting the concert items as separate programs, they became “part” of the skit put up by the award winning team (from 2005 courtesy skit competition). The audiences were presented with an array of programmes: two dance items (one of which won Silver award at 2005 SYF Competition) and one Indian Dance item. There were many highlights, to mention a few, a singing item “Love You More Than I Can Say” and a demonstration of “Kok Kok Mee” by two senior citizens and a Lion Dance put up by students of different ethnic groups.

The audience were captivated by the feast to say the least and responded with thunderous applause. The concert ended in a high note with the lighting up of “fire crackers”, with compliments from Mr Benng Chng.
