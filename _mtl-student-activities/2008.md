#### **Senior Citizens' Life Stories 2008 <<城南往事>>**

A team of 5 teachers together with 21 students from our school embarked on a meaningful project of compiling the life stories of 30 elderly living in Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng constituency. Guided by the teachers, the students interviewed the elderly who had valuable life experiences to share. Their stories were written in Mandarin by the students and edited by the Chinese Language teachers. These articles was compiled and published as a book. The book will contain 30 articles and photographs of the elderly as well as reflections from some of the students who interviewed the senior citizens.  
  
The book will be distributed to Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng constituency's grassroots organizations, Kreta Ayer Seniors Activity Centres as well as to all the Sec Schools in Singapore. It will also be used as a reading resource for all Chinese Language students in our school. The project which started in January this year and completed by October 2008. Book launched on 1st Nov at Kreta Ayer CC by Dr Lily Neo, MP Jalan Besar GRC.  
  
Through involving our students in this worthwhile project we believe that they will be able to:  
  
\- Strengthen their bond with the older generation and learn valuable lessons through the interaction  
\- Become caring and compassionate individuals with a strong sense of civic engagement Develop    their creativity and writing skills  
  
Many of today's elderly are part of the greatest generation. They lived through depression, the wars and raised families in an ever-changing society. It would be a loss to society if their stories remain untold. Thus, these memories can now be preserved through this collection.

#### **Xi’An Students’ Exchange Programme 2008.**

On 7th July 2008, which happens to be a Youth Day holiday, four teachers and sixteen Xi’An students from the 38th High School, Xi’An arrived in Singapore for a five days exchange programme with Outram Secondary School. During their stay in Singapore, they visited many renowned landmarks in Singapore such as the Esplanade, Merlion Park, Civilian War Memorial and the Asian Civilisations Museum. They also had the opportunity to experience the rich ethnic and cultural diversity of Singapore by visiting places like Little India, Chinatown, Chinatown Heritage Centre and Kampung Glam.

On 8th of July, the teachers and students arrived in Outram for a two days immersion programme where the students get to experience a day in the life of an Outramian by attending lessons with their Outramian buddies. They also participated in floorball and rockclimbing activities which were specially arranged for them. On the second day of the immersion programme, the Xi’An students got to try their hand at Malay Dance, Henna Painting and making of traditional Peranakan snack, ‘Ondeh Ondeh’. At the end of the 2 days of school immersion programme, both the Xi’An students and Outramians presented two performances during the farewell party.

In addition to the two days of classroom experience, the Xi’An students also get to bond with their Outramians buddies after school hours during their two nights of home stay with our Outram students. Parents also played as great hosts as they took good care of the Xi’An students during their stay with them. Though the time spent was brief, it was an enjoyable experience for both the Xi’An students and Outramians as they get to learn about each other’s culture and lifestyle.
