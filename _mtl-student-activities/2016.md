#### **Chinese New Year Concert 2016**


On the 5 February 2016, the entire school population came together to celebrate the Chinese New Year at the main school hall. To show our care and concern for our neighbouring residents, 40 senior citizens under Project Sphere were also invited to join us in the festive celebration as well.

  

The Mother Tongue Language Department prepared and presented many interesting and exciting programmes at the concert. The performance items include Korean Pop Dance item, Indian traditional dance & Drumming Performance as well as song items by our teachers and pupils.

  

The performing arts groups such as Concert Band and Guzheng Ensemble serenaded the audience with melodious tunes.The highlight of the concert was the arrival of the God of Fortune and the legendary Monkey King 《孙悟空》from the story Journey to the West,  much to the delight to the staff, senior citizens and pupils.The concert ended with group singing led by the Principal and staff of the school, followed by the tossing of yusheng and light refreshment for the 40 senior citizens and staff at the amphitheater.
