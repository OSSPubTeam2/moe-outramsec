#### **Cultural Immersion Tour - Xi'An to Singapore 2010**

On the 7th July 2010, a group of 20 students led by the Vice Principal, Head of Department and three teachers arrived in Singapore for the 6 days 5nights exchange programme with our students. During the 6 days exchange programme, they visited famous landmarks such as the Singapore Flyer, Sentosa, Esplanade, Merlion Park and also experience the rich culture of the different ethnic groups by visiting Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam.

Other than visiting the various sights and attractions in Singapore, the 20 students also participated in a range of activities and classes prepared by our teachers such as Malay Dance Class by Mdm Elyani, the making of Bunga Manga by Mr Hazlan, Henna Painting by Mrs Selvan (Senior Teacher) and her students and the crafts using recycled materials by Mrs Pauline Chia (SH Craft & Technology), tchoukball conducted by Mrs Faith Tan-Wong and Rockclimbing conducted by Ms Serene Cheong and Mr Ong Kok Heng and students from the Climbing Club. They students had a great time but nothing can beat the 2 nights of stay they had with their Outramian buddies. The Outramians and their parents played hosts to the 20 Xi’An students and showed them much warmth, care and hospitality.

The exchange programme ended off on a high note on the 11 July 2010 where the teachers and students from both Outram Secondary School and Xi’An 38th High School sung the Mandarin song ‘Friends’.

#### **Cultural Immersion Tour to Beijing and Xi'An 2010**

On the 28 May 2010, our teachers, Mdm Tan Kim Choo (HOD MTL), Mr Lim Say Chionh (HOD IT) and Mrs Faith Tan-Wong (SH Character Education) led a group of 26 students to Beijing and Xi’An on a China immersion programme. During the first 3 days, the group travelled to Beijing and visited famous landmarks like the Great Wall of China, Forbidden Palace (Imperial Palace), Tiananmen Square and Heavenly Temple. In addition, the group also visited the three Beijing Olympics Venues, the Bird’s Nest, the Water Cube and the Olympic Garden.

After the three days in Beijing, they then travelled over to Xi’An where we embarked on the focal point of this visit, the exchange programme with the Xi’An 38th High School. The students had the opportunity to interact with their Xi’An buddies and stayed over at their place for 2 nights. Many of them were teary eyed during the farewell gathering. At the same time, the teachers and students visited many significant historical landmarks while they were in Xi’An such as Forest of Stone Steles Museum, Terra-Cotta Warriors and Horses Pits, Big Wild Goose Pagoda, the Ming Walls and Hua Qing Hot Spring.

Despite the many challenges which they encountered at the airports such as delayed flights, the students enjoyed themselves tremendously and gain a wider understanding of the history and culture of China. Through the exchange programme, they also made many good friends and understood the value of kindness and hospitality.

#### **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2010.**

What better way to usher in the year of the tiger than to be entertained by the agile footwork, dazzling costumes and vigorous playing of the percussions by the Lion Dance Troupe! The audience was then treated to more fanciful footwork and nimble movements by our Outram Hip Hop dancers and Malay dancers in “Bom Bom Pow” and “Asmaradana”. The concert would not be complete without our singing sensations, winners of the 2009 Outram Superstar who sang 《吻别》and《三个心愿》. How can we forget our in-house celebrity Arvind and his classmates who crooned “Karikalan Kala Pole” as well as the locally renowned artist, Mr Koh Hong Yang who proved that he is gifted in more ways than one when he sang the teochew folksong《老兄卖杂货》. The school’s band and Chinese orchestra also performed three songs 《贺新年》、《大地回春》and《迎春接福》which received thunderous applause from the audience. The climax of the concert came with the arrival of the God of Fortune and the twelve Zodiac Animals. The concert was pushed to greater heights when the audience participated in the Zodiac Animals Game and when they scrambled to receive the red packets that were given out by the God of Fortune. Besides being a day of celebrations, it was also a day where we shared our good fortune with the senior citizens from the neighbouring communities by treating them to yusheng and simple lunch fare at the amphitheatre after the concert.
