#### **Chinese New Year Celebration 2011**

The Chinese New Year Concert put up by the Mother Tongue Language Department started off with an entertaining music video featuring our school staff in the New Year song 《恭喜恭喜》. Next, senior citizen Mdm Lily Chan presented us with a song “Whatever will be will be”. The audiences were dazzled by our school dancing groups who performed Modern Ballet Dance “Pursuit Of Happiness”, Malay Dance “Kurik Kundi Dance” and Indian Folk Dance. Some of our Chinese students also showcased their singing talent in the songs 《阳光宅男》，《你不会知道》and 《I Still Believe》. The climax of the concert came with the arrival of the God of Fortune and his assistant, the Rabbit. The God of Fortune hosted a game show “The Twelve Zodiac Animals Game” which gave non-chinese students the opportunity to pair up with International students to guess Chinese idioms. Their lively participation brought fun and laughter to the concert. The concert would not be complete without the melodious music pieces from our school Band and Chinese Orchestra. They played New Year songs《恭喜恭喜》and 《新年歌》respectively. Towards the end of the concert, the agile footwork and the performance put up by the Lion Dance Troupe added to the festive atmosphere in the school hall. The last item was the group singing of the song 《贺新年》by our school staff and invited guests. After the concert, all invited guests and school staff proceeded to the amphitheatre where they were enjoyed yusheng and light refreshment.
