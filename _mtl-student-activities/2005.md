#### **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2005.**

On the 8th February 2005, the Mother Tongue Department collaborated with the PCCG (Pastoral Care and Career Guidance) Department to bring the festive joy to the senior citizens who are living at Banda Street. The MT Department raised funds for the senior citizens through the sale of “greeting cards”. Besides raising funds for the senior citizens, the citizens were also invited to the concert specially organized by the teachers of the MT departments. There were dance items put up by TL and ML students, as well as our Dance society. There were also music performances by our Chinese Orchestra and not forgetting the finale, “恭喜恭喜”by our Principal, Mdm Choy and all of our teaching staff.
