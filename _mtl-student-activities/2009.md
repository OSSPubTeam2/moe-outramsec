#### **Senior Citizen Art Exhibition 2009**

The exhibition consists mainly of the works by renowned local artist Mr Koh Hong Yang. The art exhibition which features Mr Koh’s works is an inspiration which originated from the Mother Tongue department’s book project depicting the senior citizens’ personal journey and life experiences. Mr Koh as one of the interviewees expressed his desire to provide younger Singaporeans an opportunity to view his body of works. It is hoped that the exhibition can inspire Outramians to develop a lifelong passion and perseverance in perfecting their talents. In conjunction with the art exhibition is also see a photo display by the staff and students on Outram in an effort to promote visual arts as part of the learning culture in Outram.
