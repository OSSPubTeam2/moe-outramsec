At Water Polo, members are constantly reminded of the purpose of joining a CCA - to build stronger character and friendships.

To accomplish that goal, the CCA focuses on two aspects – resilience and friendship. Students were encouraged to share the problems that they were facing with their teammates before and after trainings. The team then work in smaller groups to share tips and to provide support to one another. This is based on the belief that learning is multiplied when every individual puts in effort to help another teammate day by day. By habitually discussing their strengths and weaknesses with one another, the team will grow stronger.

Even though the National Inter-School Water Polo Championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the students found ways to conduct CCA online during the circuit breaker period.&nbsp;

Student leaders organized team-bonding activities through the video conferencing tool “Zoom” three times a week.&nbsp; They also collaborated with eleven other CCAs to collect essential items to be donated to different beneficiaries such as migrant workers, needy students and needy families.&nbsp; After three months of hard work, they collected and packed an estimated two thousand care packs which were distributed to the respective beneficiaries.
