The Outram Climbing Club is a passionate team of youth climbers who strive hard to achieve their goals together. A motivated and disciplined group, the Outram Climbing team trains three times a week to sharpen their skills and build their strengths.

Prior to the yearly National Schools Bouldering Championship and National Schools Speed Climbing Championship, the climbers would train even more intensively to prepare themselves. Year on year, the team achieves stellar results in both competitions.
