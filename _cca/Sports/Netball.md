Outram Netball is more than just a CCA that teaches skills and techniques of the sport. It has been an avenue for character development of talented young women from generation to generation, where they grow to be more than outstanding sportswomen, embodying the spirit of resilience and servant leadership.&nbsp;

Apart from their regular training sessions, netballers have a multitude of opportunities to gain exposure to competitive matches at the national level, and friendly matches with friends and alumni of Outram Netball. Every year, Outram Netball team participates in an array of major competitions that are highly recognised in the netball arena. The wide range of exposure was essential for the holistic growth of Outram Netballers. Team bonding activities were also strategically organised at various points of the year in order to enhance teamwork and camaraderie within the team.
