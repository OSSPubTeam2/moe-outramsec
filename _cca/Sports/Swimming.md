Once again 2021 has been a trying year for sports CCAs with various challenges due to Safe Management Measures. Despite the cancellation of the Inter-School Swimming competition the swimmers continued to train hard towards their personal goals. Some of them got a chance to take part in the Pesta Sukan Swimming meet organised by ActiveSG in August.&nbsp; We will keep our spirits up,&nbsp; persevere and hopefully get a chance to take part and do well in the National Schools swimming competition in 2022.
