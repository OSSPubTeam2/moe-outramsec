In Robotics Club, students learn about and take part in programming, coding and automation as well as other technology-related areas. The students learn and work in groups and are provided with opportunities to collaborate with their peers to generate innovative ideas.  
  
At the beginning of the year, the seniors from Robotics Club attended workshops on Emerging Technology and shared their learning with their peers and family peers through posters and short videos. They also attended a series of workshops conducted by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to learn about Artificial Intelligence and its roles in society.  
  
  
  
A group of Secondary Three students also took part in a Mircobit Programming competition organized by Nanyang Polytechnic. They made use of what they had learnt from these workshops to design and code for a prototype targeted to improve the recycling system.  
  
Besides competitions and workshops, the students were also involved in VIA projects. Students were challenged to identify and consider possible options in addressing social concerns. Students learn to innovate, think and communicate and collaborate with their peers.  
Through the various learning experiences, members of the club get to develop their personal character and become caring contributors and innovative leaders of the 21st century.
