The Entrepreneur Club is a platform for students who are interested in Business Studies or Business Management. Through the various activities and training sessions conducted, the members learn how to be responsible, creative, innovative and committed students. The members get to experience first-hand the fundamentals of running a shop independently. With guidance from their seniors and teachers, the members acquire crucial business knowledge such as deciding on the selection of snacks and drinks which will appeal to the student population, stock-taking, customer service, and acquisition of IT skills like the use of Google Forms for surveys and Canva for poster design.  
  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic this year, CCA activities were suspended from April. Nevertheless the Club had been able to conduct team-bonding activities and a day camp in Term one which helped to forge a strong sense of belonging within the CCA. The Entrepreneur Club is definitely the choice CCA to unleash the entrepreneurial dare within students.
