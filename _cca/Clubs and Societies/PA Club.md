The Outram Secondary School Public Addressing (PA) Club has been an integral member of the school community, giving invaluable technical support and assistance to ensure the smooth running and execution of school events. It is a student-driven CCA, where training sessions are set regularly by the seniors for the young members to be trained for rigours of school events they need to be in charge of. Students exhibit strong resilience, perseverance and responsibility through their service they provide to the school through the CCA.
