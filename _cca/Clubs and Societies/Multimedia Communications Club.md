The Multimedia Communications Club (MCC) is an info-comm club for language and media lovers. We gather and develop talents in oratory skills, creative writing, and multimedia projects. As MCC’s goal is to empower members to be confident communicators, we hone our members’ speaking and writing skills by conducting training in media technology, drama, public speaking and videography, and have invited external trainers to conduct workshops on areas such as Public Speaking and Short Film Making. MCC members participate in language and media-related competitions each year. In recent years, members participated in the National Digital Storytelling Competition, The Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Writing Competition, and the Ministry of Education’s Our Schools, Our Stories Photo Contest.
