The Outram Dance Club is an aesthetic group that is always in the limelight during the school’s Speech Day and other major school events. Our members have performed a wide variety of dance styles – from traditional folk dances to modern jazz and hip-hop.  
  
Through their tireless effort in constantly learning and improving their dance routines, they have embodied the school's SPIRIT values of perseverance, sense of belonging and teamwork.
