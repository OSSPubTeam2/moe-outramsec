The Outram Concert Band is committed to providing a quality music education to all members who start out as our budding musicians. Being a key member in the music ensemble, each member will be expected to be knowledgeable in both theoretical and practical aspects so as to enhance their musicianship as they are nurtured over time in the band. The music ensemble’s is only as strong as its weakest player. Hence, the Concert Band focuses on team building through activities and conversations, providing opportunities for members of the band to work closely together. With perseverance and through teamwork, members can look forward to forging strong friendships with a strong sense of belonging to the ensemble.

**Music Training**

No pre-requisites or theoretical knowledge is required. Fundamental musical skills from note-reading, rhythm-counting, singing and breathing skills would be taught to all members. From the basic skills, students will be taught transposition skills, fundamental techniques of their instruments. Student musicians will have the opportunity to experiment with their instruments as they learn how to play from basic tunes to ensemble music, where they would play together with their peers in full band setting. A diverse range of genres from classical band repertoire, flexi-band arrangements to popular tunes from the 60s to Billboard hits will be available to the ensemble!

**Leadership Opportunities**

Every musician in Outram Concert Band will eventually understand the Leadership structure within the CCA and have the opportunity to lead and serve members on various platforms. Students will be given responsibilities to organise events within sub-committees for the annual Band Camps, Parents’ Night and Band Investiture. Suitable members who have shown commitment and leadership abilities or interest may be appointed to serve the Executive Committee for a particular year.

      <p> Bonding activity between NCC and the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) cadets:  
Beyond the Inter-Uniformed Group games during regular training days, the two units had also spent an entire morning together at Alexandra Canal. Cadets from both units had to complete various tasks such as map reading and fact finding along the canal. These activities drew on themes of environmental awareness and basic topography skills, while providing the cadets the platform to do cooperative learning.<br>  
  
Since July 2020, NCC Outram has switched to e-learning platforms in Phase 2 of the Covid-19 situation. With the help, guidance and support of HQ NCC, our cadets are still able to be nurtured as caring and concerned citizens, learning how to keep mentally and physically fit through the videos and modular courses that are made available online.
