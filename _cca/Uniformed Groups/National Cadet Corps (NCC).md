<p>The National Cadet Corp (NCC) is a CCA unlike any other. NCC promises
perspiration, involves inspiration and teaches values. In NCC, cadets are
groomed to become compassionate student leaders, who contribute to the
development of self, unit, school and nation, through fun and challenging
military activities.</p>
<p>Cadets receive basic training in footdrills, individual field craft and
navigation while experiencing exciting and meaningful sessions organised
by their cadet leaders and teachers. All cadets will undergo training sessions
and camps organised by the NCC Headquarters. Senior Cadet Leaders will
also have a first-hand experience of live-firing the SAR-21 rifle and attend
the Specialist Course, which nurtures them to be confident, disciplined,
resourceful, responsible, and resilient commanders.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Cadets (Secondary 1)</strong>
<br>Cadets receive basic training in footdrills individual field craft and
navigation while experiencing exciting and meaningful training organized
by their cadet leaders and teachers. Cadets will also undergo trainings
and camps organised by HQNCC.</p>
<p>Some of the thrilling activities they get to participate in include Flying
Fox and Camp FORGE, where they learn about working as a team and the basic
fundamentals of archery.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Cadets (Secondary 2)</strong>
<br>Cadets’ trainings will continue to be fun and challenging. Throughout
the year, they will be presented with opportunities to boost their confidence
level and play significant roles in planning and facilitating school events.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of a senior cadet is the technical handling of the
SAR-21 rifle during Camp STEEL, where they will also attain some leadership
skills.</p>
<p><strong>Cadet Leaders (Secondary 3)</strong>
<br>In their third year as a proud member of Outram NCC, cadets will take
up leadership positions in the CCA. They will be given various roles to
play such as the Platoon Commander where they lead an entire platoon of
either the junior or senior cadets. Cadets will also get to go for live-firing
and Specialist Course. Those with higher potential as leaders would get
to attend the Senior Specialist Leaders’ Course where they will be guided
on facilitation skills to elicit learning from the cadets.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Cadet Leaders (Secondary 4/5)</strong>
<br>Cadets will play a significant role in guiding the newly appointed cadet
leaders to play their roles as student leaders well.</p>
