The National Cadet Corp (NCC) is a CCA unlike any other. NCC promises perspiration, involves inspiration and teaches values. In NCC, cadets are groomed to become compassionate student leaders, who contribute to the development of self, unit, school and nation, through fun and challenging military activities.  
  
Cadets receive basic training in footdrills, individual field craft and navigation while experiencing exciting and meaningful sessions organised by their cadet leaders and teachers. All cadets will undergo training sessions and camps organised by the NCC Headquarters. Senior Cadet Leaders will also have a first-hand experience of live-firing the SAR-21 rifle and attend the Specialist Course, which nurtures them to be confident, disciplined, resourceful, responsible, and resilient commanders.  
  
**Junior Cadets (Secondary 1)**  
Cadets receive basic training in footdrills individual field craft and navigation while experiencing exciting and meaningful training organized by their cadet leaders and teachers. Cadets will also undergo trainings and camps organised by HQNCC.

**Senior Cadets (Secondary 2)**  
Cadets’ trainings will continue to be fun and challenging. Throughout the year, they will be presented with opportunities to boost their confidence level and play significant roles in planning and facilitating school events.  
  
Among the highlights of a senior cadet is the technical handling of the SAR-21 rifle during Camp STEEL, where they will also attain some leadership skills.  
  
**Cadet Leaders (Secondary 3)**  
In their third year as a proud member of Outram NCC, cadets will take up leadership positions in the CCA. They will be given various roles to play such as the Platoon Commander where they lead an entire platoon of either the junior or senior cadets. Cadets will also get to go for live-firing and Specialist Course. Those with higher potential as leaders would get to attend the Senior Specialist Leaders’ Course where they will be guided on facilitation skills to elicit learning from the cadets.  
  
**Senior Cadet Leaders (Secondary 4/5)**  
Cadets will play a significant role in guiding the newly appointed cadet leaders to play their roles as student leaders well.
