The National Cadet Corp (NCC) is a CCA unlike any other. NCC promises perspiration, involves inspiration and teaches values. In NCC, cadets are groomed to become compassionate student leaders, who contribute to the development of self, unit, school and nation, through fun and challenging military activities.  
  
Cadets receive basic training in footdrills, individual field craft and navigation while experiencing exciting and meaningful sessions organised by their cadet leaders and teachers. All cadets will undergo training sessions and camps organised by the NCC Headquarters. Senior Cadet Leaders will also have a first-hand experience of live-firing the SAR-21 rifle and attend the Specialist Course, which nurtures them to be confident, disciplined, resourceful, responsible, and resilient commanders.
