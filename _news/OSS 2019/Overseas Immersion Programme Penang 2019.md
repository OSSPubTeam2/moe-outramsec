On 29 October, a group of 25 students from Secondary 3/1 and 4 teachers embarked on a 4-day Overseas Experiential Learning Programme (OELP) in Penang, Malaysia. The programme aimed to promote meaningful interaction between our school and our hosts in Penang and to allow the students to develop an appreciation of the historical and cultural connections between Singapore and Malaysia.

One of the highlights of the trip was the school visit to SMK Abdullah Munshi. The students were honoured to be invited to their school’s annual military drill competition and were greatly impressed by the precision drills performed. They also had an engaging time interacting with their assigned buddies during their visit and experienced a taste of some lessons that were conducted.

The students visited many interesting attractions in Penang, including world-renowned heritage sites like the Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, popularly known as the Blue Mansion for its stunning blue façade, the Pinang Peranakan Mansion and the Penang wall murals. They also had the opportunity to visit Penang Hill, where they were met with stunning views of the city skyline. In addition, the students were given the chance to try their hand at batik painting and Penang pastry making.

The 4-day experiential programme came to a close all too soon on 1 November as the students brought home their precious learning experiences from their cultural interactions and insights into Penang.
