Celebrating the Year of the Pig! 

  

Outram welcomed the year of the pig with a sensational celebration filled with bountiful laughter and good cheer! The highlights of the celebration included an impressive lion dance showcase, a dazzling concert put together by talented teacher and student performers, and an exuberant _'lo hei'_ with our elderly guests who joined us in the festivity. Students and teachers had a wonderful time preparing for and being part of this joyous celebration. Happy Chinese New Year!
