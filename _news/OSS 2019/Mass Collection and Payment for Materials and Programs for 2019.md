To make fees payment more hassle-free, the school is embarking on a mass collection exercise in mid-February 2019. Parents will receive a notification letter from the school detailing all the enrichment programs and costs of materials or other items incurred in the course of the school year.

From February, the school will issue monthly statements to inform parents of the amount payable. For payments of enrichment programmes, co-payments by students will be deducted directly from their Pupil Edusave Funds. 

Where Edusave funds are insufficient, parents are strongly encouraged to pay outstanding balances through the following modes of payment:

* Interbank GIRO (Please approach the General Office for GIRO form/GIRO Option application form)

* Website : [www.axs.com.sg](http://www.axs.com.sg/)

* AXS Mobile Apps

* AXS Stations

For further information, please contact the school at 6733 4077. Thank you.
