On 29 October 2019, a group of Outramians consisting of 22 students and 3 teachers departed from Changi Airport to Shanghai, China for a 5-day Cultural Immersion Programme.

Upon arrival, they visited Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Foreign Languages School and Shanghai Liaoyuan Bilingual School, which strengthened the collaboration and marked the international partnership between both schools. The students were also given the opportunity to attend several lessons, giving them a first-hand experience of the life of a student in Shanghai.

One of the highlights of the trip was a visit to Shanghai Disneyland. For both teachers and students alike, watching the parades and touring the grounds brought back many childhood memories. The Outramians also visited the Bund, renowned for its rich history and architecture, which provided a captivating skyline along the Huangpu River. In addition, the students visited Tiangzifang, the renowned touristic arts and crafts enclave that grew from a traditional residential district within the French Concession area. Through their visit to the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center, the students learnt about various innovative strategies employed by the city to overcome the challenges faced in urban planning.

As with all good things, the precious 5-day experiential programme came to the end with the students bringing home treasured memories and invaluable insights into the rich culture of Shanghai.
