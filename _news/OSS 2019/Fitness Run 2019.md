**Run for life; run for your life and run for mine!**  
  
On 5 April 2019, Outram Secondary turned out in full force at Punggol Waterway Park, turning the venue into a riot of school house colours –red, yellow, blue, green and purple. Both staff and students alike participated in this sporting event gamely. This year, the alumni of class 1969 joined in the fun and even led the students in a rousing fitness musical routine!  
  
Congratulations to the runners who clinched podium places and everyone else who persevered till the finishing line! Rain or shine, this event is definitely a firm favourite with Outramians, especially when the cheering competition “heats up”.
