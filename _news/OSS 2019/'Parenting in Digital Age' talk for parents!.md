Dear Parents,

Finding it hard to keep up with or to manage your child in the digital age? Have always wanted to be in sync with your child but not sure where to start? 

The Media Literacy Council and the Singapore University of Technology and Design, supported by Google, are organising a talk entitled ‘Parenting in the Digital Age’ on **Wednesday, 21 August (1.30pm – 5pm)** at **LEVEL 3, Mapletree Business City**. This is a complimentary event that is open to the public. 

For this talk, we have invited local and international cyber experts to speak about the most pressing digital parenting issues, such as screentime management and cyber safety. We are honoured to have Professor Sonia Livingstone from the London School of Economics deliver the keynote presentation.
