**Wishing all Outramians Happy “Puthandu Vazthukal” and a Wonderful International Friendship Day!**

  

14 April 2019 (Sunday) marked the commencement of the Tamil New Year. Both Tamil and non-Tamil students and staff could hardly contain their anticipation as this time of the year usually marked the sampling of delicious food, colorful costumes and great dance routines. There was also the perennial favourite activity of Rangoli, as performed by the Secondary 2 cohort. The best design went to a pair of Outramians from Secondary 2/2B. Coincidentally, this was the week to commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD) and the Secondary 3 cohort enjoyed themselves thoroughly presenting about different Southeast Asian countries during their Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) periods. The assembly programme on the 17 April saw a pulsating performance-cum-quiz session on “Puthandu Vazthukal” which hosted by student emcees. Apart from well-choreographed student dances and an exciting pop quiz on the New Year, there was also a fascinating costume parade of different Southeast Asian costumes by staff and students. The whole programme was nicely rounded off by a surprise dance item by teachers.
