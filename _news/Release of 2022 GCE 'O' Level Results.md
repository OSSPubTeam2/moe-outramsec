“I have gained so many opportunities and made lifelong friends in Outram. No matter where I go in the future, I will always remember Outram as a place that has shaped me into who I am today.

Outram has made me a more confident person and helped broaden my perspectives on many different issues. I’ve had many opportunities to practice and improve my soft skills such as public speaking, networking, and leadership. I am blessed to have really devoted teachers who showed care for us beyond just our academic achievements.

A big THANK YOU to Ms Woo and Mr Abdul! Ms Woo, you’ve taught me to uphold the school’s SPIRIT values and helped me to grow into the person I am today. Mr Abdul, I admire the way you guide students and show us how Social Studies is connected to so many other issues in the real world.

The months leading up to the ‘O’ levels were very hectic and stressful, but it was nice to know that we were all in it together. I am proud that we all made it.”

“When I first started out in Outram, I was in the Normal (Technical) stream. I thought I would not do so well in school, but I managed to move into the Normal (Academic) stream.

What contributed most to my growth was the support and encouragement I got from my teachers, for example, my Math teacher Mr Lim, who was also my CCA teacher-in-charge. Under Mr Lim’s tutelage, I was also encouraged to take up many leadership opportunities in my CCA (Basketball). Whenever I faced any obstacles, my teachers were always there to help. I thank all my teachers for their encouragement.

I will miss the time spent with my friends during recess. We have a tight bond and show concern for one another.

I believe that if you want to succeed, you have to build connections with the people around you, as they have strengths in special areas. Such connections will help you in the long run.”

“The three years I spent in Outram passed by quickly, but the time I spent here was meaningful to me.

I met fun people and responsible teachers who pushed me to become a better person, helped shape my character, and pushed me to love studying. Because of their passion, I was driven to pursue my goals. I would especially like to thank my Physics teacher Mr Marcus Huang, who taught me to love the subject.

My CCA experience in Concert Band has also developed me into a better person in terms of leadership, teamwork, and innovation. I was able to transfer these skills into my studies too.”

“When I first joined Outram, I was very shy. Though I was hesitant to take on new leadership roles, my friends and my teacher Ms Woo encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. Eventually, I was selected to be the PSL President. I am really thankful to them for motivating me to be a more confident person who is willing to try new things.

I am thankful to all the teachers; they are really patient, encouraging, and sensitive to my needs. Especially Mr Huang, who is always motivating me to do my best. My teachers also encouraged me to step outside of my comfort zone by taking on more leadership roles. I am also grateful for all the friendships I made in Outram. My friends inspire me with their kindness and their strength to overcome failure.

**Tan Jing Yi** **S43**

“My experience in Outram strengthened my tenacity and resolve because I learnt that I should be ambitious and strive for the things that I want, and to towards the goals I set for myself.

I took on some leadership roles such as class Chairperson and CCA President of Dance. As I took on more responsibilities and guided my juniors, I became more confident and comfortable reaching out to people.

The teachers in Outram also contributed a lot to my success. My teachers were willing to answer my incessant questions, and I gained a lot of valuable feedback from them that helped me improve in my work.

Whenever I was not feeling my best, my Form Teachers would comfort me and guide me to find my way out of any adversity. My supportive friends also helped to steer me in the right direction when I first came to Outram.”
