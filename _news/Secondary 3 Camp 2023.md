From the 9th to the 12th of January 2023, the Secondary 3 Cohort participated in a 4-day residential Outdoor Adventure Camp at the MOE Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. They embarked on thrilling adventures including dragon boating, urban hiking, outdoor cooking and various team-bonding games.

  

As many of the students had never participated in these activities before, they stepped out of their comfort zones and took these challenges head-on. Â  A particularly special moment from the camp was the Reflection Night on the camp's third and final night. The students were encouraged to share their feelings and experiences through a group sharing with their classmates.  

  

This activity undoubtedly cemented bonds of friendship and camaraderie within the class as the students trusted their peers with their hopes and aspirations. The students did themselves proud by braving the sun, the heat and the exhaustion of physical outdoor challenges. They proved their mental resilience by embracing the difficulties encountered with a positive and cheerful spirit. All in all, the camp was certainly an empowering experience that the students will remember for a long time.
