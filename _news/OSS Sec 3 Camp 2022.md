Learning is not confined in the classrooms. For the secondary 3 students, they picked up invaluable life skills and lessons during the Secondary 3 Camp held in May.

  

Through wide ranging activities such as hiking, outdoor cooking and team-bonding challenges, the students ventured out of their comfort zone and were pushed to take responsibility for their actions while learning the importance of communication and teamwork.Â  For many of them, the highlight of the camp was definitely dragon boating. More than just a fun and exciting activity, this team-based sports gave the students plenty of opportunities to appreciate the significance of being resilient, humble and a team player.
