What started as a street parade to liven up the festive mood during Chinese New Year celebrations, became a parade that is participated by diverse groups of people from various cultural backgrounds.

This year, a group of Outramians were privileged to attend the preview and were treated to mesmerising light shows, thrilling BMX stunt performances and spectacular sing and dance acts. The floats which are a mainstay of the parade were a sight to behold as well.

The theme, “Embrace Tomorrow” resonated throughout the whole show in no small part due to local talents, Hossan Leong, Siti Khalijah and Dwayne Lau who hosted the show with much vigour and enthusiasm that made spectators feel excited about the future.
