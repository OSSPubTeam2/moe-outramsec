Outram ushered in the Year of the Ox with a morning of festivity and jollity. Despite the Covid-19 restrictions, the celebration was nothing short of fun and exuberant! 

  

Students were meaningfully engaged in craft activities and fully immersed in an impeccable virtual concert put together by the Mother Tongue Department. It was indeed a great time of festivity!
