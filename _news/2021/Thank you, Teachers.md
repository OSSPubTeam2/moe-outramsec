It was a special day of appreciation for Outram teachers, albeit a quieter one compared to celebrations in the past before the pandemic. Students showed their gratitude in different ways, presenting gifts and handwritten notes of appreciation to teachers who have made an impact on their lives.  
  
The Student Council prepared thoughtful gifts for all the teachers and put together a video documenting uplifting well-wishes and engaging performances.  
  
The classrooms were filled with good cheer and occasional laughter as teachers and students enjoyed the programmes prepared by the Student Council, CCE department, Outram Chinese Alumni and the School Advisory Committee.  

  

Aptly, the Outram Long Service Awards were also presented on the same day, to applaud teachers who have been in the service for 5 to 35 years. The school also congratulated nominees of prestigious awards – President’s Award for Teachers 2020 and Outstanding Youth in Education Award 2020.

It takes a big heart to shape little minds. Our teachers are truly deserving of all the appreciation they received on this day.
