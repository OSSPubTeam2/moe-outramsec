#OSSCARES was a Values-In-Action (VIA) project to prepare care packs for different groups of needy people in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic. A selection of Secondary 3 CCA leaders were given the opportunity to lead its planning and organization. They gathered donation items using social media and collaborating with different partners like the Old Outramians’ Association (OOA) and the Water polo Parents’ Support Group. Kreta Ayer Family Service Centre helped to coordinate the distribution of the VIA Care Packs. A total of 2090 VIA care packs and a large quantity of other donation items were distributed to selected needy pupils in school, rental units near the school, Migrant Workers Centre and Saint John’s Home for the Elderly.
