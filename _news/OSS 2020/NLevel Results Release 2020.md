**Dear Parents,**

  

The N-Level results will be released soon. It is a major milestone for our teens. Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know that they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define them or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will be especially valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions and be positive when deciding on their next steps.

Continue to have open conversations with your teen about their interests and choices and build their pathways together.

For more resources on providing social and emotional support, affirming your teen, and supporting your teen’s transition through post-secondary education, please refer to the web links below.

For ECG counselling services, students may contact the ECG Counsellor in their schools. Students may also contact the ECG Centre @ MOE (Grange Road) for online or phone counselling appointments between 10 to 23 December 2020 via email: [moe\_ecg@moe.gov.sg](mailto:moe_ecg@moe.gov.sg), the appointment booking form: [https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre](https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre) or phone: 68311420 (operating hours are 9.00 am to 5.00 pm on weekdays and 9.00 am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays).

  

We encourage all students to return to their schools to collect their results. However, for students who are unable to return to school, they may view their results online. Please refer to the link below for the guide to access the SEAB results release system.
