The Outram Students Celebrating the ARtS (OSCARS) was a great platform of aesthetic performances. It involved several budding musician-performers from our school, wanting to express themselves freely through the arts. The OSCARS provided an opportunity to pursue their passions. For those who might be shy, this event allowed them to be brave, discover themselves and conquer their fears. Several students built on their strengths and focused on making a great impact in their music and dance performances.  

On 3rd Aug 2022, there was a pre-recorded show of the OSCARS held from March earlier in the year, showing how the students harnessed technology like the Slido App to vote online, tapped on their unique talents in instruments like the ukulele and came up with meaningful group names like '4 Direction' and '3 peas and a pod'.

The OSCARS event was a blend of student-emcee led interactivity and pre-recorded perfection. As such, the assembly item demonstrated graceful dance choreography and deep musical passion provided ample entertainment to an appreciative audience, while adhering to safety management measures. Several of the performers also took time to perform at the School of the Arts, at the “Fire of Youth” Music Competition held on 30 July 2022, to encouraging cheers and applause.

All in all, this was a wonderful showcase that showed how Outramians pursued their dreams, from concept to reality.
