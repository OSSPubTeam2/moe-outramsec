The Outramians of Class 2021 demonstrated perseverance amidst trying times due to the global pandemic. They had to overcome the challenges of adapting to an entirely new mode of learning. After years of classroom-based lessons, the Class had to get comfortable learning new content, skills and values through home-based learning.

The impressive results for both GCE N-Level and O-Level are a testimony to how the Class have become confident self-directed learners.
