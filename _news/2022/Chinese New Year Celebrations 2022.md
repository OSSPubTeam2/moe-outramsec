The school ushered in the Year of the Tiger through an exciting CNY celebration. The festive celebration kicked off with an exciting Kahoot quiz that came right after a video presentation on the history and significance of the CNY tradition. Following that, Secondary One students got their creative juices flowing in a card-making competition. Meanwhile, students from the other levels artfully designed digital CNY stickers.

The students were also treated to a visit from the god of fortune and other significant characters from the Chinese folklore.

The highlight of the celebration was the CNY concert which was presented in the form of a pre-recorded video. The concert featured a slew of performances and CNY greetings from students, alumni, teachers and staff. A roaring round of applause from students and teachers may have marked the end of the celebration but the Year of the Tiger was just about to begin.
