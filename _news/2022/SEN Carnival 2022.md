This year’s SEN (Special Educational Needs) Carnival was held on 28th October and there were plenty of game and activity booths set up by student leaders throughout the school. Students enjoyed themselves immensely as they bolted from one booth to the other, collecting booth stamps after completing each activity.

In one of the booths, participants learnt to sign their own name in sign language. One other booth got participants to go through an obstacle course as a three-legged pair.

All in all, students reflected that the carnival helped them realise the importance of being an inclusive society and to acknowledge that there is strength in diversity.
