On 20 May 2022, the Sec 4 and 5 students were treated to a slew of eye-opening talks presented by both tertiary educators and industry professionals. After the uplifting opening address by Principal Mr Boo Hian Kok, the students split into groups and were given a peek into student life by the engaging speakers from the schools of Hospitality and Business and Service from ITE, the School of Business from Singapore Polytechnic and the School of Digital Design and Development from the Republic Polytechnic. 

  

Former Outramians such as Mr Nelson Ko, Mr Zander Widjaja, Mr Ong Kah Jing, Mr Ng Yi-Xian and Ms Chua Chaiyun took the stage next to talk about their adventures since they left school and how they brought their IT, advertising, documentary production and early childhood education careers to new heights. The students filled the session with enthusiastic questions about the ins and outs of crafting a viable career while absorbing every wise word from their predecessors. 

  

The finale of the day’s program was no less than an insightful and highly energetic talk by the entrepreneurial people from Lazada. It was certainly a most rewarding morning the students spent, gathering information and planning for their tomorrows.
