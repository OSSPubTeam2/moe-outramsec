After two years of celebrating the national day in classrooms, Outramians are thrilled to gather at the main hall and enjoy this year's celebrations.  
  
Early in the morning of the celebrations, the school witnessed the observance ceremony which was proudly led by cadets from the school's National Cadet Corps unit who were joined by a a few peer support leaders and members from the school's Concert Band.  
  
Later during the celebrations, students were treated to brilliant live performances including skit and dance. They also enjoyed music performed live by an exclusive band whose members include the school's very own Vice-Principal, Ms Guineve Yeo.  
  
This year's National Day celebrations is definitely one to remember!
