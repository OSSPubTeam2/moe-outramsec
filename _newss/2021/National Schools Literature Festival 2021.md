Several of our Secondary Two and Four Literature students represented our school in the National Schools Literature Festival 2021 on 9 July and did our school proud through their enthusiastic participation.

Eight of our Secondary Two students took part in the Lower Secondary Book Trailer event. Out of 57 participating schools, their entry received a commendation in recognition of their hard work and creativity.

Three of our Secondary Four students took part in the Upper Secondary Unseen Poem Debate category. They put up a strong fight against the opposing team and presented their arguments with great confidence.

We congratulate our students for their keen participation and are proud of their efforts!
