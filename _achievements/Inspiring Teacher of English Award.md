The school is proud to announce that one of our very own English Language teachers, Ms Lim Yean Yue, Gladys, has received the Inspiring Teacher of English Award 2022.  
  

This is a national award for English teachers that acknowledges teachers who are not only effective in helping students to communicate accurately, but also inspire their students to have a strong passion for English Language. When asked how she sparks joy in her students, her answer is student-centricity.

In her own words, “My philosophy as an English Language teacher is that teaching, learning and assessment in the classroom have to be student-centred.” It is through the enactment of this philosophy that all her students, regardless of their profile and language proficiency, truly enjoy learning the language. She also firmly believes that every student can and wants to learn and that her role in the classroom is to scaffold their experiences of language learning. Through such a clear understanding of her role as a teacher in the classroom, every one of her students gets to experience success which encourages them to learn even more.

Congratulations Ms Gladys Lim, for being conferred this prestigious award, and a huge _Thank You_ for motivating the students and for being an inspiration to the English Language teaching fraternity
