On 1 September 2022, 13 teachers from various schools received the LEAP Award from Minister for Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing.  

Among them was Ms Gladys Lim Yean Yue, a Geography and English Language teacher from Outram Secondary School.

When asked about how she felt upon receiving the award, Gladys reflected, "The LEAP award means a lot to me as an educator because it focuses on the heart of teaching - which is to develop students into individuals who can and want to contribute to society. To be conferred this award is a great honour and testament to my belief that while caring deeply for our students takes time and effort, it is an investment that bears great rewards."
