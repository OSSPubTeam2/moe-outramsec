On 27 July 2019, Outram Netballers from the C Division Team found themselves pitted against opponents from schools all over Singapore at the Teens Network Club Under 14 Netball Carnival 2019. Despite the sweltering weather, the warriors on the courts of Kallang Netball Centre dominated the games and made it to the top. Congratulations to Outram Netball for clinching overall champion at the annual event!
