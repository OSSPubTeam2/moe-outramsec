On 4 March 2023, Outram's Special Education Needs Officer Ms Li Jiayi was awarded the 2023 Social Action Award by the British Council.

At Outram since 2016, Ms Li provides support for students with Special Education Needs. As a Special Education Needs Officer (SENO), she provides specialised interventions and skills training in specific areas of learning disabilities, and works closely with teachers, parents and external agencies and professionals to support students with SEN.

The Social Action Award is given to those who have made exceptional contributions and commitment to creating positive social change and improving the lives of others. Ms Liâ€™s efforts have certainly made a tangible difference in the lives of our students with SEN and has cultivated a school culture of inclusivity and diversity. She is a wonderful asset to our school and deeply valued by staff and students alike. Outram is grateful for Ms Li's contributions and warmly congratulates her on her well-deserved recognition.
