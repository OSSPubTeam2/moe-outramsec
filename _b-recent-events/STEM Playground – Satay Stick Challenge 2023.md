Outramians had a joyful learning experience as they took on the STEM Playground Challenge hosted by Singapore Science Centre and James Dyson Foundation in March 2023.

The challenge was for the students to create a bridge that can support at least 1kg load. The students were given 50 satay sticks and tape.

The construction of the bridges progressed quickly as our budding innovators became more proficient in coming up with creative ideas to build impressive bridges.
We are proud that the students demonstrated positive learning attitude towards building the bridge, experimenting on different designs and working on multiple iterations to see which design works best to support the different types of weight.

The experience has brought about much meaning that science, technology, engineering and mathematics exist in our daily lives.
