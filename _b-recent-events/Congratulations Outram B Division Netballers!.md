Congratulations to our B Division netball players. They bled and toiled in the heat. They fought tooth and nail for every misplaced shot and angled pass. Netball Outram defiantly battled against their more illustrious opponents, and won fans for their resolute playing and sportsmanship. Kudos to all the alumni, present school supporters, coach\* and of course the teachers for letting the girls explore their fullest potential. This year saw Netball achieve one of its best ever placings in the South Zone B division championship - a very respectable third runner up position! Well done!
