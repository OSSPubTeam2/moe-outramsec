The Live On Festival is annual competition that encourages participants, in particular youths, to express their thoughts on organ donation and transplantation through art and writing. It is organised by the National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU), Ministry of Health (MOH).

The Secondary 2ENA students took part in the Essay Competition and also attended a sharing session conducted by NOTU where they shared the spirit and goals of the competition. Out of 53 winning essays, Jaiaree Rattawit, also known as Tun, from Sec 2/3 was selected as an award winner for his situational writing essay. 

He reflects:

“Truth be told, before participating in the festival, my knowledge of organ transplantation revolved mainly around the pain of the medical procedure. Although aware of the limited supply of donated organs, I was ignorant of its impacts, such as the rise of cross-border black markets for the sale of organs. Through the festival, I began to comprehend the complexity that went into finding a suitable organ donor and gained the understanding that individuals have the option of donating their organs at the final stages of their lives. I believe that despite advances in technology, humans should remain proactive in donating organs as it is our duty to help one another, especially those in need. I would
highly encourage other students to participate in the festival to play an active role in highlighting the plight of the organ recipients and the selflessness of the organ donors, greatly increasing the possibility of perfect organ match between the two parties.”

We congratulate our students for their keen participation and are proud of their efforts!

Labor Omnia Vincit.
