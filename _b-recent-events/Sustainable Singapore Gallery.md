In Outram, we nurture students to be caring contributors who contribute meaningfully to the community. One way is through our level-wide Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes which are learning experiences that students go through to learn and apply values, knowledge and skills.

On 24 March, our Secondary One students embarked on a Learning Journey to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery to learn about the development of Singapore's sustainability efforts and journey. This complements the sustainability learning in our school curriculum. Through the hands-on activities and interactive gallery walk, our students gained precious knowledge which they can leverage for their VIA projects.
