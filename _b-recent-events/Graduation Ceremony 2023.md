Good morning, my dear Outramians, teachers, and most importantly, the incredible graduating Class of 2023, Today, as we gather here to celebrate this monumental day, I'm reminded of the famous lines from Robert Frost's poem, "The Road Not Taken." Frost writes, "_Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference_." These words beautifully encapsulate the essence of this moment in your lives.

Let us reflect on the choices you've made throughout your journey in secondary school. Each of you has faced moments where decisions had to be made — choices that have shaped your path, your character, and your future. Frost's poem reminds us that the choices we make, even the seemingly small ones, can have a profound impact on our lives. Embrace those choices, for they are the building blocks of your unique journey.

We are currently living in a world with fragmenting global order, fragile economic system, fractious domestic politics and rapid technological change, what do you think success will look like for our students in 30 years?

From the latest speech given by Minister Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education at Work Plan Seminar 2023, I quote the following key points: 

_For us to succeed, every student needs to be a creator, a connector and a contributor going forward. Let me explain why I have chosen these three words to focus our attention on this year. In today's world, there is no credit or bonus for us to teach our students to only know how to answer yesterday's problem with yesterday's answers. Knowledge is increasingly commoditised unlike five to 10 years ago, where knowledge might have been a premium. However, it is no longer the case now because we have educated our people better. Knowing the answers to today's problems or yesterday's problems is necessary, but no longer sufficient. Our students can only distinguish themselves in 20 to 30 years' time if they are able to create something new, and if they can create new value for themselves, for our country and for the global system._

_Without that, if we cannot distinguish ourselves, if we are just pedestrian, we will be destined to only work for other people who can create new things, which is why every student should aim to be a creator. In this fractious world, we need to learn how to collaborate with other people, not just domestically, but with our overseas partners. The more the world threatens to fragment, the more we need our people to be able to connect with people from different persuasions and different backgrounds. This will become an essential life skill, not just for them in Singapore, but beyond Singapore. If Singapore as a small nation cannot connect with different parts of the world, then our raison d'etre \[the most important reason or purpose for someone or something's existence\] will be gone. This is not just about individual competencies. It is also about our nation's survival._

_Last but not least, why the word "contributor"? In the next leg of our nation's economic development, we cannot just have a narrow definition of success, where some people who have succeeded academically are seen as the beacon for everyone else. We need to appreciate the diversity of strengths required for our society to be much more resilient. We need to respect one another for their diverse talents. But more importantly, we want every Singaporean to know that in the next lap of our nation's development, everyone can contribute something. It is not just about those who have succeeded academically who can contribute. Every one of us, every student, regardless of our station in life, must have the confidence that they can contribute something, beyond finding meaning in their own personal achievements._

This is the essence of broadening the definition of success. It is not just about broadening the definition of success from academic to non-academic, personal achievements. It is broadening the definition of success, from personal achievements to collective contributions. If we can do that, we will have a much more heartwarming society, a much more cohesive society, a society where everyone feels respected and valued. That is what we need to strive towards._

In Singapore, our Ministry of Education emphasises civic literacy and citizenship dispositions. Recall the four citizenship dispositions? They are Sense of Belonging, Sense of Hope, Sense of Reality and Will to Act. It's about more than just academic knowledge; it's about understanding your roles and responsibilities as active, informed citizens of our nation. You are not just graduating students; you are graduating citizens, and with that comes the duty to engage in your communities, contribute to the betterment of society, and uphold the values of integrity, empathy, and inclusivity.

Now, let's consider the idea of students as creators, connectors, and contributors. In your time her in Outram Sec, you have not only absorbed knowledge, but you've also been encouraged to create, to think critically, and to innovate. You've connected with your peers, your teachers, and the broader community, learning the importance of collaboration and understanding diverse perspectives. And most importantly, you've been nurtured to be contributors—individuals who actively give back to their communities, making a positive impact wherever they go.

As you stand at the threshold of a new chapter in your lives, I want to share my best hope and confidence for your future. I have seen your growth, your resilience, and your capacity for greatness. I have witnessed your determination in the face of challenges and your ability to adapt to a changing world. You are a generation with immense potential, and I am confident that you will not only make a difference but also inspire others to do the same.

In this world, which often feels uncertain and complex, remember that you have the power to choose your path—the road less travelled, if you will. Embrace the civic values you've learned, be creators, connectors, and contributors, and never lose sight of your potential to effect positive change.

In closing, let me express my pride and admiration for the graduating class of 2023. You are not just our future; you are our present, and I have every faith that you will lead with courage, compassion, and integrity.

Congratulations, graduates! The road ahead may be uncertain, but with your choices, your education, and your values, I am confident that you will make all the difference. Thank you for being the bright beacons of hope and inspiration that you are.

May your journey be filled with boundless opportunities and endless success. Congratulations once again!

**Mr Keith Tan**
