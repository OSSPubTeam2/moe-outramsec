From 20 to 22 March this year, OSS students from the Sec 3 and 4 NA and NT classes spent three days of experiential learning at the ITE Central, ITE East and ITE West! They enjoyed the opportunities to take part in different fun and hands-on modules such as Fun with Home Networking, Beauty Services, A Taste of Art & Service of Cooking, Creating a 2D computer game, Cruising Into Maritime Industry, Design And Build Your Own Glider, and Fitness For Life.

Applied Learning Modules (ApLMs) are special short-term classes offered by ITE to give secondary school students a taster of possible educational progression and career pathways, which enable students to make more informed choices upon graduation from secondary schools.

The ApLMs help students discover their interests by providing them with opportunities that involve doing and applying, learning about the real world, and learning for life.

The icing on the cake is that students who complete the modules are awarded a Certificate of Completion and one advanced credit standing for exemption from elective modules in ITEâ€™s full-time Nitec programme. It takes just three days of enriching fun to kill two birds with one stone!
