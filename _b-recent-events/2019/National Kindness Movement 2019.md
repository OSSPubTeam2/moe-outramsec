The following four students from the Secondary 2 cohort demonstrated their creative style and flair, as they composed poems for this year’s ‘Write for Kindness’ Competition (a national writing competition), which is organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement. One pair had come in 2nd place and another pair was also awarded a consolation prize.

 The following winners are:

Aarthi Kris & Isabelle Oentoro (2nd place for ['A Helping Hand’](/files/Achievements/National%20Kindness%202019/Aarthi%20&%20Isabelle's%20Poem.pdf)); and

Jefferson Kwek & Low Jay Yee (consolation prize for [‘A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed’](/files/Achievements/National%20Kindness%202019/Jefferson%20&%20Jay%20Yee's%20Poem.pdf))
