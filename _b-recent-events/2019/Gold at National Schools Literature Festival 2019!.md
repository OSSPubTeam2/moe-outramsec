Eight secondary 2 and 3 Literature students participated at the National Schools' Literature Festival 2019 on 22 July and did our school proud in clinching top awards for their respective events!  

The Sec 2E team clinched the Gold Award for the Book Parade based on the novel - The Boy in Striped Pyjamas, and the Sec 3E team won their debate match against Marsiling Secondary School on a motion on set poems. This is our 3rd consecutive win in both categories.&nbsp;We congratulate the deserving students for their wonderful efforts!
