Giving beyond their 100% at every training session, Outram dancers put their best foot forward for the Singapore Youth Festival 2019 in the International Dance category. Their synchronised and supple movements on stage showcased their artistry as dedicated members of Dance Club and unity within the dance troupe â€“ the key ingredients for success in this art form. A testament to their hard work and commendable performance, the Dance Club was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment at the competition. Well done, Outram dancers!
