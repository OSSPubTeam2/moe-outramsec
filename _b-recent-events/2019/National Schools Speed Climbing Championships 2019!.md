**Outram soars to greater heights at the National Schools Speed Climbing Championships (NSSCC 2019)**  
  
On 30 Mar, an adrenaline and exciting sports event took place at our very own York Hill. Of the four overall championship divisions up for grabs, Outram persevered to sweep away the B Division Girls, the C Division Girls and Boys titles. Every Outramian climber demonstrated true grit and tenacity to ensure this resounding success, not just in terms of victory, but also as an event. It was a great platform for all athletes from all schools to display true determination and excellent sportsmanship.

All the climbers performed exceedingly well! Congratulations once again to our climbers for the following results:
