On the 2nd of March 2023,Â  Secondary 1 Outramians discovered the practical applications of Mathematics in real-world contexts, through an engaging and enjoyable Mathematics Trail. The activities extended student learning beyond the classroom to facilitate the application of mathematical concepts. Students worked together to estimate the maximum capacity of the school canteen, compute the average speed of a moving toy car, use a clinometer app to calculate the vertical height of a building, and measure the height of fellow students using a metre ruler.

Demonstrating a commitment to promote lifelong learning, the innovative Mathematics Department teachers have created authentic scenarios to challenge students and nurture their problem-solving skills, while promoting the joy of learning. Through teamwork and critical thinking, the Secondary 1 Outramians have indeed deepened their understanding of how to solve authentic problems.
