Two teams of Frisbee players from Sports and Recreation Club took part in the Inter-School Ultimate Frisbee Competition 2022 organised by Jurong West Secondary School.  
  
Despite the lack of competitive experience among the students, both teams performed to the best of their ability. One of the teams qualified for the quarter finals while the other achieved a 4th placing in the competition.  
  
To the Frisbee players, congratulations for your valiant effort!
