#### Assessment in Outram Secondary School 


#### For Parents


 
**What is Assessment?**

Assessment is the process of gathering and analysing evidence about student learning for making appropriate decisions and enhancing learning. It is used for making decisions about students, curricula, programmes and educational policy, with a view of providing information to students, teachers, schools, parents, other stakeholders and the education system.

**Purpose of Assessment**

  

**●**   Formative Assessment should help to build skills that will be tested in summative assessments, by identifying learning gaps and assessing students’ level of understanding based on learning objectives.  
  
● Summative Assessment should provide information on students’ mastery of Learning Outcomes based on the subject syllabuses at key milestones. Information from SA should be used formatively to refine future lesson objectives and formative assessment accordingly.

  
**Modes of Assessment**  
  
● Formative Assessment  
  
Throughout the year, students will work on different assignments and activities that help them increase what they know and practice their skills. These activities will allow them to demonstrate how they are doing, what their strengths are and where they can improve. Teachers will use this information to adjust their classroom instructions, and provide students feedback on how to close their learning gaps.  
  
● Weighted Assessment  
  
Weighted Assessments are scheduled termly to check for students’ understanding to close learning gaps and prepare students for the summative assessment at the end of the year. Appendix A illustrates the assessment weightings of the different subjects your child is taking.  
  
● Summative Assessment  
  
During the school year, students will sit for the end-year examination to demonstrate their learning for the year. Summative Assessment will take on the following formats:  
  
  

|                      |                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Secondary 1, 2 and 3 |            End-of-Year Examination           |
|   Secondary 4 and 5  | Mid-year Examination Preliminary Examination |

  

**Communication with parents**
