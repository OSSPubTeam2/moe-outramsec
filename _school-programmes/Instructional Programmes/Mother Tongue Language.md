The Mother Tongue Language department strives to make learning fun and enriching for our students. Other than instilling in our students a love for the language and an appreciation of their culture, we are also focusing on inculcating the right values and better understanding of other cultures.

			<p> <b>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight (MTL Fortnight)</b><br><br>

In support of MOE’s efforts to promote student learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures, the school organised a myriad of activities and programmes during the Mother Tongue Fortnight for each language.<br><br>

				<b>Chinese Language Unit</b><br><br>

MTL Fortnight was held in conjunction with the Chinese New Year Celebration.<br>

Keeping to the tradition, the school was decorated with red cloth, couplets, lanterns and other auspicious items to bring out the festive atmosphere. Traditions and customs were also discussed and taught in class, with quizzes and “red packets” (sweet treats) given to the students.<br>

We also ushered in the Year of the Ox with a Card Design Competition, and had our mascot and God of Fortune make rounds in the classrooms, bringing well wishes to the classes<br><br>
