**Department Vision:**

Every Outramian a Lifelong Learner, Innovative Leader and Caring Contributor.

**Long-term Goal:**

To develop students’ mathematical thinking and problem solving skills through 4 key domains.

**4 Key Domains**

1.      **Instructional Strategies:** Anchoring on the philosophy of Differentiated Instruction to employ a repertoire of strategies that focuses on Inquiry-Based Learning. The use of Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach helps students to visualise and understand mathematical concepts.

2.      **Effective Assessment:** Conducting alternative assessments and differentiated assessment (assessment for learning, assessment of learning and assessment as learning) to examine and inform students’ level of understanding. The regular feedback from such assessments provides students with many opportunities to improve learning.

3.      **Effective Use of ICT:** ICT-based activities are designed to help students visualise, explore and investigate mathematical ideas and relationships that would enhance the understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and eventually groom students to be digital literates.

4.      **Character Development:** Teaching of 21st Century Competencies, Social Emotional Learning and values through daily lessons and enrichment activities.
