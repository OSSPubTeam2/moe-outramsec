This year, we embarked on a department wide learning framework. This learning framework encompasses the different processes taken in Food and Consumer Education, Design & Technology, Art and Music. This is the building block behind the department mission.

  

The Craft and Technology department is a fusion of Art and Design, Music, Food and Consumer Education and Design and Technology. In this department, we encourage Outramians to experiment and think out-of-the-box to appreciate and apply strategies to generate creativity together with basic fundamentals. It provides opportunities for students to be innovative, dynamic and above all, daring. This website will showcase how design has evolved and is being integrated into our curriculum.
