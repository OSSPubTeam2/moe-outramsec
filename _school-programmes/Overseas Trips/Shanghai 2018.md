**Overseas-Experiential Learning Programme 2018 – SHANGHAI**

During the November break, a team of 22 Secondary Three students and 3 teachers travelled to Shanghai for a 5-days Cultural Immersion Programme.

Outram Secondary School’s visit to Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Foreign Languages School (SICFLS) marked its 6th year of collaboration. The visit strengthened the international partnership between both schools and provided our students with an insight to the life of a business student in Shanghai.

One of the highlights was a visit to a high school to observe how lessons were being taught and to have a taste of their instructional program. It sought to provide students an opportunity to learn and interact with youths from a different culture, developing in them 21st Century Competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills.

Our students visited the architecturally rich Bund which provided a captivating view of the skyline and the nearby Huangpu River. They also visited Xin Tian Di, an urban attraction that holds the historical and cultural legacies of the city. It is a fashionable pedestrian street composed of modern architecture style and a blend of both Shanghai in the 1920's and the modern urbanites of the 21st century. The 5-day experiential programme came to a close as students brought home precious insights into the rich culture of Shanghai.
