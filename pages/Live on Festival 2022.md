**Live On Festival 2022**  
 

The Live On Festival is a competition that encourages participants, in particular youths, to express their thoughts on organ donation  and transplantation through art and writing. It is organised by the National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU), Ministry of Health (MOH). This year, more than 2200 artworks and 1800 essays were received from 83 schools and 61 schools respectively from both competitions.

Our Outramian students participated in the competition in various capacities:    

*   The Secondary 1 students took part in the Design Competition.

  

*   The Secondary 2ENA students took part in the Essay Competition and also attended a sharing session conducted by NOTU where they shared the spirit and goals of the competition.

  

*   The students of the Multimedia Communications Club CCA took part in both the Design and Essay Competition.  
    

  

Out of 53 winning essays, Heidi Teh Elie from the Multimedia Communications Club (Sec 3/3) was selected as an award winner for her situational writing essay.  

We congratulate our students for their keen participation and are proud of their efforts!
