#### **About NE**


National Education is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our students, confidence in our nation's future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.

MOE has adopted a two-pronged approach in the cultivation of national instincts among pupils: First, to develop an awareness of facts, circumstances and opportunities facing Singapore, so that they will be able to make decisions for their future with conviction and realism. Second, to develop a sense of emotional belonging and commitment to the community and nation. This approach is amply captured in the phrase "engaging hearts and minds".

The objective is to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in the future,

*   by fostering a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans;
*   by knowing the Singapore story -- how Singapore succeeded against the odds to become a nation;
*   by understanding Singapore's unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries;
*   by instilling the core values of our way of life, and the will to prevail, that ensures our continued success and well-being.

"Head, Heart and Hands" framework

*   The "Head, Heart and Hands" framework was recommended by the Committee on NE in March 2007, and guides the next phase of NE.

*   In engaging the “Head”, students should be actively involved in their own learning; beyond knowing, they should think through issues and arrive at a deeper understanding of the challenges facing Singapore and what it means to be Singaporean. In engaging the “Heart”, students should connect emotionally with the Singapore story; their love for the nation should be the outcome of their appreciating Singapore and having a deeper sense of belonging. In engaging the “Hands”, students should have opportunities to give back to society, and realise that everyone has a part to contribute to and create Singapore’s future, and, where possible, to lead in different fields of society.
*   The three principles in the second ring – Quality, Customisation and Ownership, are guiding principles that underline all of the Committee’s recommendations. In particular, going forward, more emphasis should be given to a customised approach. For example, as students progress from primary to secondary levels, they should gradually move from understanding basic facts about our nation’s past, to understanding how Singapore is evolving in the present. As they move into post-secondary levels, the engagement should deepen their grasp of the complex challenges facing Singapore, while they ponder the possible futures for our nation.
*   The outer-most ring represents three key groups of stakeholders that are involved in the delivery of NE – educators, students and the community. This reinforces the idea that NE is owned by everyone, and emphasizes the importance of community partners in the process of NE.

**International Friendship Day**

*   IFD will provide a good opportunity for students to explore Singapore’s connection to the region and the world.
*   Students must value the good relations we share with our neighbours and beyond.
*   We need to teach them that such relations cannot be taken for granted.

_IFD commemoration could serve to:_

*   allow students to examine how communities in Southeast Asia are connected through cultural, economic and geographical ties, this will help them to learn the value of maintaining good relations with our neighbours in the region.
*   help students gain a deeper appreciation of regional cooperation and also recognize how an active foreign policy has enabled us to maintain our international space and good relations with neighbouring countries.
*   infuse students with a global outlook that makes them open to working well with people of different cultures; both within Singapore and in the world at large.
*   help students understand how the successful integration of Singaporeans and new immigrants will contribute towards Singapore’s continued success as an economy, society and nation.
*   guide, challenge and correct students’ misconceptions / stereotypes of new immigrants and provide a platform for them to express acceptance of foreign cultures and norms.

**Racial Harmony Day**

*   Students should understand the customs and traditions of the different races and religions.
*   They should learn to respect these customs and traditions and the need for the different races and religions to coexist peacefully.
*   Students should also learn about the consequences of a breakdown in racial and religious harmony.
*   These lessons can be drawn from our own history as well as recent incidents in the world.
*   The message is that racial and religious harmony cannot be taken for granted.

  

**National Day**

*   National Day marks our Separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as an independent country in the community of nations.
