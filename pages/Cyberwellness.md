**What is Cyber Wellness?**   

Cyber Wellness (CW) in CCE focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

These are the key messages which students will understand:

 1.       Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities   
 2.       Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence    
 3.       Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace
