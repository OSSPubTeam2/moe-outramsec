Our sincerest congratulations to Selvie from the Class of 2016! A committed and self-confident student councillor at Outram Secondary School, Selvie progressed to Anderson Serangoon Junior College and aced her GCE “A” Level Examinations in 2018. Both schools are extremely proud of her haul of four distinctions. She demonstrated exemplary values of responsibility and perseverance embodying the essence of a true Outramian. Well-done, Selvie!
