#### **DEAR OUTRAMIANS,** 


I stand in awe of the rich history and heritage that Outram Secondary School stands for since its inception in 1906.

  

Paying tribute to educators, alumni, parents and partners past and present who make a positive and resounding difference in its enduring efforts to develop Lifelong Learners, Innovative Leaders and Caring Contributors, I hope that all Outramians appreciate this goodwill and kindness, and commit ourselves to building on and propagating this benevolence for generations of Outramians to come.

  

In navigating through the secondary school experience, the School Leaders and teachers would like to espouse our shared beliefs that – we value every Outramian for each of us is unique with intrinsic worth, bringing with us our personal strengths, interests, passion and learning needs; we want every Outramian to succeed where each of us pursues our hopes and dreams and where our Outramian staff are committed to open vistas and find pathways to energise us to live a purposeful life; we believe all Outramians can learn and become self-directed and collaborative, digital and connected learners who exercise critical and inventive thinking, taking a leaf from our Outramian staff in role-modelling the desire to learn and the process of learning. 

  

Opportunities abound within the rich and diverse Outramian school experience to explore, internalise and live out our Outram SPIRIT values: Sense of Belonging, Perseverance, Integrity, Responsibility, Innovative, Teamwork. As we embark on this uplifting expedition to discover our purpose and aspirations, we also want to assure all Outramians that we value strong positive teacher-student relationships and peer support culture in classes and student groups, and would like to entreat all of us to be an active contributor in cultivating healthy, inclusive and supportive relationships, and in sustaining a safe, vibrant and conducive learning environment.   

As a Principal, our MOE Citizenship Dispositions resonate with me deeply, and it is my fervent wish that under the caring influence and guidance of our Outramian staff that each of us nurtures the Sense of Hope, the Sense of Belonging, the Sense of Reality, culminating in the Will to Act. And in developing these dispositions, I invite all of us to reflect how we can help each other

*    feel heard and belong in the school environment;
*    appreciate diversity;
*    empower ourselves to contribute to the school and community;
*    support our well-being; and
*    work together.

Quoting from the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew,

 **“To the young and to the not so old, I say, look at that horizon, follow that rainbow, go ride it”** 

and from Robert Frost in his poem titled “The Road Not Taken”

 **“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference.”**

I am proud to declare and will continue to establish Outram Secondary School as a place for growth and learning. Our desire is for every Outramian to step out of our comfort zone through resilience-building and responsible decision-making, and to step up to seize new opportunities and responsibilities to serve our peers, our school, our community and our nation.
