We will go marching on together

True to our Alma Mater,

We will strive and march to victory,

Loyal Outramians are we.

  

**CHORUS:**

  

Onward, friends, be true, sincere,

Work and foes we must not fear,

Never falter, never fall,

Labour conquers all.

  

We will raise our standards high,

And with our voices cry;

Brave and true hearts we will always be,

Loyal Outramians are we.
