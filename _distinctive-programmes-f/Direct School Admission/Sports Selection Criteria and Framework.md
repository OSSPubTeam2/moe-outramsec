##### Outram Secondary School Direct School Admission (DSA) – Sports for Life @ Outram

  




Outram Secondary School is committed to nurturing Champions for Sports and Life. Our mission is to **Instill Life skills, Inculcate Life values and Inspire Life-long learning through Sports.** The school has demonstrated her strength in many sports over the past years. Most students have been actively involved in one or more areas of sports during their time in school. We offer sports of different natures to suit the needs and interests of our students. Along with a committed team of teachers and instructors, Outram Secondary School seeks to bring sports to all students in order for them to embrace the school values and the core values of Character and Citizen Education, so as to bring out the best in them.  

  

As the only government school built with a swimming pool, two rock walls, three indoor sports halls, one futsal court and a comprehensive training programme, our athletes have performed well in the National Inter-School competition and some had even represented Singapore at international events.

  

To help our aspiring and talented athletes to achieve their sporting goals and excellence, the school offers a comprehensive Sports for Life Talent Development programme which provides support to assist them in their education and personal development.
