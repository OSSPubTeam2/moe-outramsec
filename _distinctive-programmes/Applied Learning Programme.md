In addition to being recognized as Center of Excellence for Business & Enterprise in 2010, Outram Secondary School’s Business and Enterprise (B&E) has been recognised as an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) since 2014. This affirms the department’s aim and vision of providing a quality education in Business & Enterprise within school and reaching out to other students at a national level.

  

At Outram, we design programmes in recognition of the diverse interests and talents in line with supporting the development of multiple peaks of excellence and preparing our students to develop future work skills.  


The programme consists of 2 tiers: Tier 1 is a 15 – 20 hours programme for all Secondary and One students while Tier 2 caters to students with the aptitude and interest as part of their talent development.

The school has established partnership with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, The Sandbox, Pearson Education South Asia Pte Ltd, Singapore Management University -The Accounting Society, and Spirit of Enterprise (SOE) to leverage their expertise to develop ALP curriculum and programs with the emphasis of Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship. 

  

**Financial Literacy with Project Moolah**

Project Moolah is organized by SMU’s Accounting Society, which aims to teach Financial Literacy to secondary school students. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the team continues to partner the school to conduct four Financial Literacy (FL) lessons for our students. The sessions introduced topics such as savings and insurance and conducted group competitions for our students to learn FL in a fun and engaging way.

Two teams from Outram Secondary School took part in the [Financial Literacy for Youths (FLY) Race/Challenge](https://www.rp.edu.sg/smc/outreach/financial-literacy-for-youths-race), an annual nationwide inter-secondary school competition organised by [Republic Polytechnic’s (RP) Common Business Programme](https://www.rp.edu.sg/SMC/full-time-diplomas/Details/common-business-programme). The event aims to cultivate entrepreneurial spirit in managing finances.

FLY Race adapted its format to an E-Challenge due to restrictions caused by COVID-19. The online challenge was conducted across two rounds between September and October.

The theme of this year’s challenge was Fostering a Sustainable Hawker Culture through Financial Savviness. The challenge created an opportunity for participants to discover the challenges faced by our local hawkers, and provided the youths an avenue to devise practical strategies to help these businesses in areas related to financial literacy and entrepreneurship.

Our team consisting of Chiang Hoe Siang (S3/4), Satidsawat Podtakon (S3/4), Ong Bing Xuan (S3/4), presented their financially savvy ideas and practices against 8 other teams during the final challenge. The team emerged victorious, winning the Most Financial Savvy Award for FLY Challenge 2021. The experience gained during this challenge was enriching and invaluable for all the participants.

**Outram Bazaar goes online!**

As a part of the Secondary 4’s authentic learning project for Business Studies,  students were tasked to procure and sell their products via the e-commerce platform this year. Students felt that the learning process was enriching as they were able to seek values and relevance of their learning and applied what they had learned in Business into the project. The engaging task allowed the students to experience being an Entrepreneur first hand and understood their challenges admist settting up an online store.
