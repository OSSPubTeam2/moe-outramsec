Outramâ€™s School Advisory Committee(SAC) shares the belief that through sport, we can instil 21st Century Competencies in each student to better prepare them to thrive in a fast-changing and highly connected world.

The SAC-Outram Sport Award reaches out to attract sporting talent to join the school and acknowledge the good performance of deserving students who display exemplary conduct.

Our sports co-curricular activities and programmes are able to maximise the potential of students to excel in their chosen sport, and in the process inculcate the school values of sense of belonging, perseverance and teamwork. We believe this helps to nurture students such that they are motivated, enjoy learning, and go on to fulfil their potential.

The strong profiling of sports in recent years has led to the emergence of students who have excelled in sports such as Rockclimbing, Waterpolo, Swimming, Netball, Archery, and Snooker. Together with our heroes from yesteryears, these outstanding students act as role models to our student population, and bring hope and a sense of worth to our students -many of whom are from underprivileged backgrounds.

The celebration and recognition of our sports students will provide an inspiration to fellow Outramians, and that there are possibilities to excel and be the best they can be through positive work ethics, hardwork, perseverance, and discipline.
