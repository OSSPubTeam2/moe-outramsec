In the continuous effort to promote the Olympic values and commemorate Racial Harmony Day, the school sent student leaders to represent Outram Secondary School to support Values @ Play 3: Be The Change Today, organized by CHIJ Kellock.

Through this, the student leaders were given the platform to hone their leadership and organizational skills.
