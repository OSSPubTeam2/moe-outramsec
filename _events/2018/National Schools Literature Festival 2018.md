The National Schools Literature Festival is a yearly affair, attended by more than a hundred schools across the nation. This year, the 2018 edition saw a bumper participation of 118 schools, gathered at Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School, to promote and celebrate the a common love for the subject.

Outram sent several teams to represent our school in the following events – Lower Secondary Choral Speaking (Secondary 1s), Lower Secondary Book Parade (Secondary 2s) and Upper Secondary Unseen Debates (Secondary 3s).

At the Lower Secondary Book Parade, our Secondary 2 team, comprising students from Secondary 2/5, got into the shoes of characters from their Literature text,&nbsp;_The Boy in Striped Pajamas_, and presented projects completed by the Secondary 2E students to a panel of judges. They blew the judges away, attaining a Silver award.

It was the first time the Secondary 3 team had pitted themselves against a debate team from another school in a competitive capacity. They steeled themselves and overcame the odds to emerge victorious in their debate as well.

The Secondary 1s put on a valiant effort in their first-ever foray into performance reading, but despite their best efforts did not manage to clinch any award. It was indeed an eye-opening experience for them.
