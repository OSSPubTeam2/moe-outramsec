It was a wonderfully proud Saturday afternoon for all Outramians, on 3 October 2020. That day marked Ardi Zulhimi's attainment of **Anugerah Mendaki Award 2020 - Special Achievement Award for Excellence (Non-Academic)** for his commendable performance in Swimming.  
  
It was an Online Ceremony held in the presence of Mr. Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for Social and Family Development and Mdm Zuraidah Abdullah, Chief Executive Officer of Yayasan Mendaki. This award aims to recognise students who have excelled in the non-academic field, and aims to inspire Malay or Muslim youths to achieve excellence in all aspects of their lives.  
  
Earlier this year, Ardi was also named ST Young Athlete of the Year 2020. Congratulations, to Ardi, for making Outramians proud once again!
