From January to March 2019, Outram students took part in the Secondary Schools Debating Championship (SSDC) organized by Julia Gabriel Centre. Our Outram debaters managed two wins out of three preliminary rounds and Justine Hari scored the Best Speaker Award in Round 2.  
  
Congratulations to our debaters: Justine Hari Muruga, Basil Hia, Brendan Lim from Secondary 45 and Maria Reyes from Secondary 32!
