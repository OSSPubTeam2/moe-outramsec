Students of Outram Ink did an excellent job in advancing to the finals of the National Digital Storytelling Competition 2019 which took place on 12 September 2019. A month prior to the competition, 5 groups of students painstakingly crafted scripts and fitting animations using PowerPoint. The team is proud to announce that out of the 23 schools which participated in the competition, all 5 groups from our school made it to the semi-finals. Outram Secondary was the only school which had 2 teams that made it to the final round. The young creative directors of Team 1 and Team 5 made Outram Ink and the school proud by clinching the 4th and 5th place in the finals and won cash vouchers. Congratulations, Outram Ink!
