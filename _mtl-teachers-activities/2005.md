#### **External Sharing 2005.**

In the September 2005, 2 teachers from our school, Mdm Chen Pingxin and Mdm Siow Wee Han participated in an event organized by the S4 cluster, “South Zone Cluster National Creative Pedagogy Collection”. The objective of the national event was to inspire learning of the Chinese language among students, and with the introduction of the TLLM (Teach Less Learn More) initiative, it became more apparent that teachers can not longer rely on traditional methods of teachings.

Mdm Chen and Mdm Siow shared with teachers from both primary and secondary school teachers on how to make Chinese language lessons come alive in class using animation. It was successful, as many teachers went back asking for tips on how to incorporate the activity in their classroom.

#### **Overseas Training 2005.**

Overseas study trip to observe and to study about the learning pedagogies and methodologies in China.

On the 19 November 2005, 20 teachers and 3 officials from the MOE, Staff Training Branch, set out on an overseas study trip to Dong Bei Normal University, which is situated at the Northern part of China (near to Harbin). Our main objective was to learn how Chinese language is being taught in the classrooms over in China. We stayed at the hostel （师训大楼）within the campus for 20 days. We went through lesson observations and lectures. During the last week of our stay, each of the 20 teachers had to teach for one period at either one of the subsidiary schools of Dong Bei Normal University ( 东北师范大学附属实验中学) or 103 High School （103中学）.

It was a fruitful trip, not only did we come back with many useful teaching resources, we also made many friends over there in Changchun as well. It was an inspiring and enriching trip, I would definitely love to go back there again and I would recommend teachers to go for it as well!

#### **Outram WITS Presentation 2005.**

On the 8th September 2005, all the teachers from the various departments came together to present their WITS project. It was a special occasion as on that day, not only were we suppose to present, we are in fact competing to see which team would clinched the award for the Best WITs project 2005.

As there were about 11 teachers in the MT department, we had to split into 3 teams: Mr Hazlan and Ms Elyani belonged to one team, Mr Elancheliyan and Mdm Mani belonged to another, and the rest of the CL teachers belonged to one team. We all presented our WITs project, though we were all from different teams, our objectives were identical, and that was to enhance and inspire learning among students.
