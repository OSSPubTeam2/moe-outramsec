#### **Visit by St Gabriel’s’ Secondary School 2010**

On the afternoon of 22nd April 2010, the Chinese Unit, Mother Department Department was visited by a group of Chinese language teachers led by the Vice Principal of St Gabriel’s Secondary School, Mr Anith Kumar and the Head of Department, Mother Tongue, Mr Lim Song Nian.

Upon arrival, Mr Kumar (Vice Principal of St Gabriel’s Secondary School) , Mr Lim (HOD, Mother Tongue Department) and teachers settled into the museum where our Principal, Mr Loh presented a welcome address. Shortly after that, our teachers, Mr Wen Zhiguang, Mrs Looi Lay Geok and Ms Chua Choo Hong and Mrs Lui Pingxin shared with them on innovative programmes which were unique to Outram Secondary School. These programmes include, fleamarket@outram, Outram Chatterbox, Senior Citizens Life Stories and the national education infused cultural lessons. After that sharing, our visitors were then brought over to our Mother Tongue Cultural Rooms where they were introduced to our three cultural rooms.

The visit ended off with a closing address by Mr Anith Kumar and an interesting discourse between the HOD of Mother Tongue (St Gabriel’s Secondary School) and our teachers.
