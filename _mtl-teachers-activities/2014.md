#### **National Sharing on Secondary School Reading Programme 2014**


Our school has embarked on the Secondary Schools Reading Project from 2011 to 2013.

On 28th February 2014, Mrs Looi Lay Geok and Ms Yang Yi were invited to conduct a Professional Sharing on the Promotion of Reading Activities in School, jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) and the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL).

An exhibition and a display of our CL students’ work related to the Reading Project for the three years were also showcased at the venue.

Both the organisers and  the teacher-participants from other schools gave positive feedback on the sharing and the exhibition.
