“Live with Tradition, Progress with Time” is our Department’s  Mission.

In line with the introduction of new Chinese Language syllabus, two teams of Chinese Language teachers from the Mother Tongue Department developed new Teaching and Learning Packages to enhance the effectiveness of the teaching of new Chinese Language textbooks as well as  making the lessons more interesting and interactive.

The two packages include Lesson Plans, worksheets, presentation slides and other IT-related resources. On 24 October 2013, our teachers, Ms Yangyi, Ms Shi Yanwei, Mrs Looi Lay Geok and Ms Xu Cuirong,  conducted two Cluster Professional-Sharings at the South Zone S4 Cluster Chinese Language New Teaching Material Sharing.
