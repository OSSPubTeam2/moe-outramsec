Six of our Chinese Language (CL) teachers attended the first international conference on Teaching and Learning of Chinese as a Second Language organised by Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL) from 17 to 19 Nov 09. The international conference themed “From Applauded Practitioners to Applied Learners” aimed to demonstrate and share practices and experiences that can create a more lively CL learning environment and engage CL learners. More than a hundred presentations from Singapore and abroad covered topics ranging from Teaching Strategies and Methods, Curriculum and Activity Design, Learner Psychology and Language Acquisition, to Cross-cultural Contact and Language Teaching, and ICT in Teaching. Our school participated in the poster presentation, sharing on how we started the Senior Citizens’ Life Stories project and how the reading material was used in the teaching and learning of Chinese Language
