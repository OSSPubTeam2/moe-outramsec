#### **South Zone Learning Festival 2003.**

In 2003, the MT department participated in a learning festival organized by the S4 Cluster. Teachers from the various schools in the S4 Cluster came together on that day to share and exchange strategies that will help students learn better.

Teachers from the MT departments combined their efforts to share on how teachers could use book review in a fresh and creative way. To better demonstrate our strategies, we not only shot our students in action using the videos camera, the TL and ML teachers even brought their students to the convention. It was quite a successful sharing session, as many of the teachers in the audience wanted to find out more about our teaching strategies.
