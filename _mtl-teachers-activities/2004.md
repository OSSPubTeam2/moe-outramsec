#### **South Zone WITS presentation 2004.**

In the year 2004, the MT department was chosen to represent the school in the Cluster WITs day. The objective of our WITs project was to help our students understand, appreciate and respect their culture as well as cultures of other ethnic groups. It was an enriching experience as we also learnt many useful strategies from the other teachers who were presenting at the Cluster convention as well.
