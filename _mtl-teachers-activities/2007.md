#### **Outram Learning Festival 2007**

On 16 November, Mrs Looi Lay Geok and Mrs Lui Ping Xin represented the Mother Tongue Department Chinese Unit to share with teachers from S4 cluster on FleaMarket@Outram. They shared on the features of the website, which is a Chinese Language version of EBAY where students use the Chinese typing software to describe the products they would like to sell online and to communicate with interested buyers. This website becomes a learning tool that encourages social entrepreneurship through the buying and selling of goods and the donation of all proceeds to the school’s Needy Pupils’ Fund. Survey results have shown that the students enjoy using this platform to learn Chinese. The teachers found it interesting and asked questions to find out more on how we carry out the actual sales transaction. Other Chinese teachers present helped to attend to the teachers’ queries. The half an hour sharing session was a short but enriching one for all.
