#### **MOE EXCEL FEST 2006**

On the 7 th and 8 th of July, teachers from the Chinese unit participated in the MOE Excel Fest and exhibited “Outram Chatterbox”, an online learning platform for students to improve their oratorical skills and to prepare them for the oral exam. With the help of 6 student leaders and teachers, visitors had an opportunity to work on their oratorical skills using the interactive learning platform. Many enjoyed listening to their recorded voices using the software on site.
