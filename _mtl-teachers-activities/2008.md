Miss Chua introduced our schoolâ€™s Culture-based National Education Infused Curriculum to enable our pupils to have a greater understanding of the traditional cultures of different ethnic groups. The activities include Chinese Calligraphy, Paper-cutting, Mask-painting, demonstrations of Malay and Indian Wedding Ceremonies etc.  
Mrs Looi shared on the features of the FleaMarket@Outram as another innovative learning platform for pupils to apply their Chinese IT skills, communication skills as well as their entrepreneurial skills in their language learning processes.  
It was a valuable experience as all participants found the sessions inspiring and enriching.

#### **Chinese Cultural Learning Experience 2008.** 

Traditionally, Chinese New Year is celebrated over a period of 15 days. This year, on the 15th day of the Chinese New Year (21st Feb 08), which is also commonly known as Yuan Xiao Jie, the Mother Tongue Department organized a Chinese Cultural Learning Experience for all staff to have a better understanding of the Chinese culture and also to celebrate this very last day of the Chinese New Year. A wide range of activities like Chinese Calligraphy, Paper Cutting, Tang Yuan (glutinous rice-balls) making and Yu Sheng (raw fish salad) demonstration were carried out and our teachers and staff had their chance to have hands-on sessions to learn the respective skills and art. We had a great time of learning and feasting, and we ended the day bringing home our own art pieces and a satisfied stomach.
