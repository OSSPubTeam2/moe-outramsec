We are a team who are deeply passionate and motivated about the sports. The OSS Basketball team trains twice a week under the supervision of our coach. We are striving to let this passion translate into better ball skills and teamwork on the courts. Thus, we are increasing our focus on physical training to toughen ourselves up in order to improve our stamina and endurance during our games.

The OSS Basketball team aims to develop the studentsâ€™ character and to provide opportunities to develop their leadership potential.
