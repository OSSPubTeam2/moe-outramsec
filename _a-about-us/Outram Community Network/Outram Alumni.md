Internal partners are the key stakeholders of Outram Secondary School. The personnel involved in an internal partnership often include parents, the school alumni, and the school advisory committee. As these partners and the school have a highly interdependent relationship, they remain highly influential yet dependent on the function of the school. Purposeful collaborations with these key stakeholders are essential to the quality of education that the school can provide. 

##### **Main objectives of internal partnerships – School Alumni**
  
* To serve as a link between alumni and the School
* To allow alumni to gather and interact, preserving and renewing old friendships
* To provide an opportunity for alumni to contribute back to their Alma mater
