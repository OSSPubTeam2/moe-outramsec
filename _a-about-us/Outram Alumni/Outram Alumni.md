Internal partners are the key stakeholders of Outram Secondary School. The personnel involved in an internal partnership often include parents, the school alumni, and the school advisory committee. As these partners and the school have a highly interdependent relationship, they remain highly influential yet dependent on the function of the school. Purposeful collaborations with these key stakeholders are essential to the quality of education that the school can provide.
