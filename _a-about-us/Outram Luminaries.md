Dr Wee Kim Wee
Former President of Singapore
<br><br>
Dr Wee Kim Wee, Singapore’s beloved former President of the Republic of Singapore needs no introduction. 
<br><br>
Dr Wee died at 89 years old in 2005, due to prostate cancer. He was President from 1985 to 1993. 
<br><br>
Born on 4 November, 1915, Dr Wee started out as a clerk in the Straits Times before becoming a reporter. He also worked for the United Press Association and was its Chief Correspondent in the 1950s. He rose to fame in 1966 after securing an interview with General Suharto of Indonesia, who announced to the world that he wanted to end the three-year long confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia. 
<br><br>
He went on to serve as a diplomat for many years, and in 1984, he took up a new post as Chairman of the then Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. A year later, he became President, determined to make the Presidency as accessible as possible to ordinary Singaporeans. He was known as a People’s President, displaying a genuine concern for others and a natural warmth that touched many lives. He retired from the Presidency in September 1993. 
<br><br>
In 1927, Dr Wee was a Standard IV student at Outram School. In his book entitled ‘Glimpses and Reflections’, he relates how he had experienced ‘the magic wand’ of Principal Captain Goodman Ambler, as a punishment for poor results due to much time spent on ‘fun for boys of my age… from rounders, basketball, fighting fish, and mischievious exploits of one sort or another’, Dr Wee attributes the following experience as the turning point which made him focus on his studies. 
<br><br>
“… Like a first-rate magician he pressed the back of my neck with his magic wand to make me bend down more and more, until my buttock stuck out like the peaks of the Himalayas. Then, without even so much as an “Alakazam”, he brought the cane down. I almost fainted. But, that very instant Captain Ambler called, “Next”. It was the most happy word I had heard till that moment, for it meant that I had qualified for only one stroke… That stroke of the magic wand helped me turn 180 degrees… for me, I accept unequivocally that if Captain Goodman Ambler had not used the wand on me, I could have ended as a dropout and ruined my life. Deep in my heart I am fully grateful to him for performing his magic.”

	Mr Wong Kan Seng

	Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home affairs

  

Mr Wong Kan Seng, studied at Outram Secondary School when it was still located at Outram Road. There, he picked up practical skills like book-keeping, shorthand and touch typing. Leaving Outram in 1963, he worked as a teacher before being recruited into the Administrative Service in 1967. After joining the Administrative Service, he obtained a diploma in Business Administration, and later, a Masters in the same subject. He occupied high positions in MINDEF and Hewlett Packard before joining politics in 1984. Mr Wong has been the Home Affairs Minister since 1994 and on 1 September 2005, he was also appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister. 

  

Mr Wong remembers his days at Outram, which was just a short distance away from Outram Prison. 

  

“Our teachers used to remind us, ‘Better do well in your studies, better be a good boy, a good citizen, if not you may land up there \[Outram Prison\], we have to see you from the outside.’ So that was the most impactful advice I think many students would take to heart. … We could still see the prisoners when they were out, I believe there was some kind of a garden or work which they were allowed out for short periods of time perhaps an exercise yard or whatever. And we could see some of them in their prison uniform. So we would never get near it, or never would want to get near the prison fence or wall at the time. Some of the teachers I remember are Mr Chan the Maths teacher, Mrs Quah, who taught us English, we have Mr Chew who taught us Chinese and we have Mr Goh who taught us book-keeping. There are many others, but these are the teachers whom I thought left some deep impressions.”

He was conferred a full professorship in 1977. He was Singapore’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) from 1968 to 1971 and again from 1974 to 1984. In between, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Singapore from 1971 to 1974. As President of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea from 1980 to 1982, he oversaw the successful phrasing of the convention’s text, which was completed by consensus, rather than the usual method of majority voting.

In his recollections, Prof Koh noted that unlike him, most of his classmates were not from wealthy homes but stayed in humble homes in Chinatown and Tiong Bahru. This made a deep imprint on his mindset and attitude towards people, and he came to respect people irrespective of their background. 

  

“In Outram School, I had good teachers. They were very strict, as compared to today’s standard… The teachers were strict with you but they would sometimes wink at you. So I knew that although they were very tough they actually cared for you.”

\[extract from full essay\]

It seems that the floods bring nothing but unhappiness and terror. But this is not so. The pupils of Outram Secondary School love floods! Yes, they welcome floods! A rainy day with floods is a welcome deviation from the humdrum routine of everyday school life. Their joy and exuberant spirits are mirrored in their youthful faces when they wade cautiously through the swirling brownish water or balance precariously on the benches ingeniously placed in the tuck-shop to form a dry passage-way. Occasionally, a squeal of laughter, a splash and a cry of exaggerated anguish is heard in the tuck-shop… … All these things are in the game, however, and the pupils take it in good form. The pupils also welcome the opportunity to release their cramped toes from their tight shoes and wade barefeet in the icy-cold water. A very funny sight on rainy days is to be seen in the tuck-shop. Imagine looking at girls and boys standing high up on tables eating and drinking unconcernedly. It is such an awkward and unorthodox position to be in. \- Koh Cher Siang, Sec. IV A. (Outram Annual, 1962).

“Just as 1990 marks the beginning of a new decade, I hope it also marks the beginning of a new generation of success for the Old Outramian’s Association. All of us, former students of Outram, recognize the noble intention behind the founding of the Old Outramians Association. In the 25 years since the Association was first formed, we have seen the promotion of exchange and friendship gain momentum and prominence. This is due in no small way to the dedication and efforts of individuals on the Committee of the Association and support from members.”

	Mr Gurmit Singh

	Actor-Comedian


As the star of Phua Chu Kang the Ch 5 comedy, Mr Gurmit Singh is a well-known face who has starred in many programmes. But how many people are aware that behind the actor-comedian was an Outramian and a strict National Police Cadet Corps instructor. He was very firm with his cadets and demanded much discipline from them. However, he was also known to be a prankster- he was often seen playing the piano in the school auditorium after it was ‘locked’- by using a duplicate key that he secretly made! As an old boy, Gurmit has attended many Outram School events, sharing with students his experiences and inspiring them to follow their dreams.

	Mr Bobby Chng 
	
	Fashion designer

  

Mr Bobby Chng is a well-known homegrown fashion-designer turned interior designer, whose fashion creations can be found at department stores and upmarket boutiques all over the world.

  

Mr Chng was an Outramian in the late 1960s, and drawing has been his first love since young. Shy by nature, he found it easier to express himself through his talent in design, and his works could be seen everywhere in school. He made models for the Science Week and helped out with decorations in the school hall on special occasions such as Speech Day and Teacher’s Day.

  

Besides being good in art, Mr Chng also did well in Biology and Technical Studies. After graduation in 1973, he took up LCCI courses before doing his National Service. After NS, he obtained an apprenticeship with an advertising firm where he learnt graphic design. He then went on to design clothes for a company. After this stint, he founded his own company, and his fashion creations have since gone on to make waves in the region and the world. 

  

As an ex-ACS Primary boy, Mr Chng initially found the Hokkien-speaking environment strange. Coming to Outram broadened his horizons and changed his perspective on life as he got to know people from different family backgrounds. Mr Chng still stays in touch with the group of friends he made at Outram. 

  

Mr Chng continues to exemplify the Outramian Spirit through his contributions to Outram’s Building Fund. At the Farewell Dinner in 1993, guests were treated to a fashion show on Bobby Chng’s creations, modelled by present Outramians.
